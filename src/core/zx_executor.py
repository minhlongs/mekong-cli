Mekong CLI - ZX-Inspired Shell Executor

Enhanced shell execution inspired by google/zx patterns:
- cd()/within() context-managed working directory
- retry() with configurable attempts and exponential backoff
- nothrow()/quiet() error suppression wrappers
- ProcessOutput with pipe-aware stdout/stderr/exitCode
- Safe quoting and escaping
