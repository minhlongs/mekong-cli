"""
src.core.orchestrator — public API facade.

All names previously exported from src/core/orchestrator.py remain importable
from this package without any changes to callers.

NOTE: The dependency imports below (RecipePlanner, RecipeVerifier, etc.) must be
present here so that unittest.mock.patch("src.core.orchestrator.X") resolves
correctly — patch works on the namespace where the name is looked up at call time.
