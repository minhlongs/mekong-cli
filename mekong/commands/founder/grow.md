```
/founder grow [--channel <type>] [--target <n_leads>] [--week <n>]
```

Channels: `cold | content | seo | community | partner | all`

## BƯỚC 0 — SCAN TRACTION STATE
```
□ Đọc .mekong/company.json          → stage, product_type
□ Đọc .mekong/reports/ (latest)     → current MRR, users, churn
□ Đọc .mekong/founder/persona.json  → ICP
□ Đọc .mekong/validate/             → customer language, pain points
□ Đọc .mekong/memory.json           → past growth experiments

Tính:
  current_mrr  = từ report
  target_mrr   = $1M ARR / 12 = $83K MRR

### CHANNEL: SEO
**Agent: Data + Editor / qwen + gemini / 3 MCU**

```
/founder grow --channel seo

SEO SPRINT:

Step 1 — Keyword research (Data agent):
  Seed keywords từ customer interviews
  
  Priority matrix:
    HIGH PRIORITY: high intent + low competition (volume 100-1000/mo)
    MEDIUM: high volume + medium competition
    SKIP: "best AI tools 2026" type — too competitive

  Output: .mekong/grow/seo/keyword-map.md
  Format: Keyword | Monthly Vol | Difficulty | Intent | Priority

Step 2 — Content brief per keyword (Editor agent):
  For top 10 keywords, generate:
    Title (H1): {keyword-optimized but natural}
    Meta description: 150-160 chars
    Outline: H2s, H3s, word count target
    Internal links: 3-5 to existing content
    Target featured snippet: question to answer
  
  Output: .mekong/grow/seo/briefs/{keyword}.md

Step 3 — Technical SEO audit (COO agent, bash):
  Check:
  □ sitemap.xml exists at /sitemap.xml
  □ robots.txt configured
  □ Page speed (Lighthouse score > 90)
  □ Mobile-friendly
  □ Core Web Vitals passing
  □ Canonical tags on all pages
  □ Alt text on all images
  
  Output: .mekong/grow/seo/technical-audit.md

Step 4 — Backlink strategy (CMO agent):
  □ Guest post targets: 10 blogs in your niche
  □ Tool directories to submit to: 20 relevant lists
  □ Podcast outreach: 5 founder/tech podcasts
  □ HARO/SourceBottle: reporter queries
```

### CHANNEL: COMMUNITY
**Agent: CMO + CS / gemini + haiku / 2 MCU**

```
/founder grow --channel community

COMMUNITY SEEDING:

Step 1 — Map communities (Data agent):
  Find 10 communities where ICP lives:
    Type: Slack, Discord, Reddit, Facebook Groups, LinkedIn Groups
    Criteria: 1000+ members, active (post/day > 5)
    Filter: {product_type} relevant communities
  
  Output list with: name, platform, size, activity, join link

Step 2 — Engagement plan (CMO agent):
  Rule: Give value 10x before promoting once.
  
  Week 1-2: Join, observe, introduce yourself (no mention of product)
  Week 3-4: Answer 3 questions/day in your expertise area
  Week 5:   Share useful resource (could be your content, not blog)
  Week 6+:  Natural mention when directly relevant

  Scripts per community type:
    Intro post template: "I'm {name}, building {category}.
      I've been {relevant experience}. Here to learn and share."
    
    Value post template: "Solved this exact problem last week —
      here's what worked: {genuine insight}"
    
    Soft CTA: "We're actually building something for this —
      happy to share early access if you're dealing with this"

Step 3 — Own community (long-term):
  When to start: After 100+ users
  Platform: Discord (free, developer-friendly)
  Structure:
    #general      → conversations
    #show-and-tell → members share builds
    #feedback     → product feedback
    #jobs         → hiring (monetization later)
  
  Launch strategy:
    Invite first 50 users personally
    Weekly "office hours" async (post update + Q&A)
    Monthly founder AMA
```
