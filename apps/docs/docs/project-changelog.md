```

**New Structure (Current)**:
```

### For Developers

**Content Contribution**:
When adding new documentation, follow the new section-based structure in `src/content/docs/`:

```bash
src/content/docs/
├── getting-started/     # Onboarding and setup
├── cli/                # CLI-specific documentation
├── core-concepts/      # Architecture and workflows
├── agents/             # Agent documentation
├── commands/           # Command documentation (by category)
├── skills/             # Built-in skills
├── use-cases/          # Tutorials and examples
├── troubleshooting/    # Troubleshooting guides
└── components/         # UI component reference
```

**Frontmatter Requirements**:
Ensure all new content includes proper `category` field matching the new section structure.
