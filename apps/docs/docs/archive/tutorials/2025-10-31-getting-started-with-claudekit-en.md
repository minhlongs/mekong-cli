## Understanding Mekong Marketing's Architecture

### How It Works

1. **You describe** what you want in plain English
2. **planner** researches and creates a plan
3. **Specialized agents** execute in parallel or sequence:
   - **researcher** finds best practices
   - **Multiple agents** write code, tests, docs simultaneously
   - **tester** validates everything works
   - **code-reviewer** checks quality and security
4. **Results delivered** with tests, docs, and professional commits

### The `.claude/` Directory

After installation, your project has:

```
.claude/
├── agents/           # 14 agent definitions
│   ├── planner.md
│   ├── tester.md
│   ├── code-reviewer.md
│   └── ... 11 more
├── commands/         # 30+ slash commands
│   ├── bootstrap.md
│   ├── cook.md

│   └── ...
└── workflows/        # Core processes
    ├── development-rules.md
    ├── orchestration-protocol.md
    └── ...
```

**Key files:**
- `CLAUDE.md` - Project instructions for Mekong CLI
- `workflows/development-rules.md` - Code quality standards
- `workflows/orchestration-protocol.md` - How agents work together

### Context Engineering (The Magic Behind Mekong Marketing)

**What is it?** The practice of providing the right information to Mekong CLI at the right time.

**Why it matters:** Mekong CLI has a 200,000 token context window (about 150,000 words). Mekong Marketing ensures this space is filled with:
- Your project's tech stack
- Code quality standards
- Best practices for your frameworks
- Project-specific conventions
- Relevant documentation

**Result:** Mekong CLI makes better decisions because it understands YOUR project.

**Example:**

Without Mekong Marketing:
```
You: "Add authentication"
Claude: "Here's a basic auth with localStorage" ❌
```

With Mekong Marketing:
```
You: "Add authentication"
Claude: "I see you're using Next.js 15 with App Router.
Based on your code standards in development-rules.md,
I'll implement Better Auth with:
- Email verification
- OAuth (Google/GitHub)
- Server-side sessions
- Protected routes via middleware
- Rate limiting
- 12 test cases
- Security best practices from OWASP" ✅
```

- Prefer functional components
- Use Tailwind CSS for styling
- Follow conventional commits
- Write tests for all features

## Prohibited Actions

- Never use `any` type
- Never commit secrets
- Never skip error handling
- Always validate user input
```

### Creating Custom Commands

Create `.claude/commands/my-command.md`:

```markdown
# My Custom Feature

Build a custom component with:
1. TypeScript
2. Tailwind CSS
3. Tests
4. Storybook story
```

Use it:
```bash
claude /my-command
```

### Adding Custom Skills

Create `.claude/skills/my-framework.md`:

```markdown

## Tips for Success

### 1. Be Specific

❌ **Vague:** "Add auth"
✅ **Specific:** "Add email/password authentication with Google OAuth using Better Auth"

### 2. Use Planning Mode for Complex Features

```bash
# For simple tasks
claude /cook add a contact form

# For complex tasks
claude /plan add real-time chat with WebSocket
claude /cook implement the chat plan
```

### 3. Build Iteratively

Instead of:
```bash
claude /cook build a complete e-commerce platform
```

Do:
```bash
claude /cook create product listing page
claude /cook add shopping cart
claude /cook add checkout flow
claude /cook integrate payment
```

### 4. Review Before Committing

```bash
# See what changed
git diff

# Review tests
npm test

# Review code quality
claude /ask review the recent changes for security issues
```

### 5. Let Mekong Marketing Handle the Details

You don't need to specify:
- Which files to create
- How to write tests
- Code formatting rules
- Documentation structure
- Commit message format

Mekong Marketing knows your project structure and standards from `.claude/` configuration.

## Troubleshooting

### Installation Issues

**Problem:** `ck: command not found`

**Solution:**
```bash
# Add to PATH (macOS/Linux)
echo 'export PATH="$HOME/.mekong/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.zshrc
source ~/.zshrc

# Windows: Add to Environment Variables manually
```

**Problem:** "GitHub authentication failed"

**Solution:**
1. Create a Personal Access Token: https://github.com/settings/tokens/new
2. Give it `repo` access
3. Set environment variable: `export GITHUB_TOKEN=your_token`
4. OR use GitHub CLI: `gh auth login`

### Command Errors

**Problem:** "Agent not found: planner"

**Solution:**
```bash
# Ensure .claude/ directory exists
ls -la .claude/

# Reinstall if missing
ck init --kit engineer
```

**Problem:** "Context limit exceeded"

**Solution:**
Mekong Marketing manages context automatically, but for very large projects:
```bash
# Use focused commands
claude /scout find auth-related files  # Instead of asking about entire codebase

# Break down large tasks
claude /plan [task]  # Review plan before executing
```

### API Key Issues

**Problem:** "Gemini API key not configured"

**Solution:**
1. Get free API key: https://makersuite.google.com/app/apikey
2. Add to `.env`:
```bash
GEMINI_API_KEY=your_key_here
```

### Performance Issues

**Problem:** Commands running slowly

**Solution:**
- Check internet connection (agents research online)
- Reduce scope: break large tasks into smaller ones
- Use `/cook:auto:fast` for simpler tasks
