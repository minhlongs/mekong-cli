# Bug Fixing Workflow

Systematic approach to debugging and fixing issues using AgencyOS's specialized debugging agents.

## 🚀 Vibe Coding Quick Start

```
/@debugger [issue description]
    ↓
TaskTracker: Analyze → Root cause → Fix
    ↓
ApprovalGate: "Apply fix?"
    ↓
/@git-manager commit fix
```

## Overview

The bug fixing workflow combines investigation, root cause analysis, fixing, and validation into a comprehensive debugging process.

## When to Use This Workflow

- Production bugs affecting users
- Test failures in CI/CD
- Performance issues
- Security vulnerabilities
- Unexpected behavior

## Step-by-Step Guide

### 1. Initial Investigation
```bash
/debug "login button not working in production"
```

**What happens**:
- **Debugger Agent** investigates the issue
- **Researcher Agent** analyzes similar problems
- Collects logs, error messages, stack traces
- Identifies affected components and dependencies

**Output**: Investigation report with:
- Issue description and reproduction steps
- Error logs and stack traces
- Affected components list
- Initial hypothesis of root cause

### 2. Deep Analysis
```bash
/debug "analyze authentication flow for session issues"
```

**What happens**:
- **Debugger Agent** performs deep code analysis
- **Database Admin Agent** checks for data issues
- **Security Agent** checks for vulnerabilities
- Traces execution flow and data flow

**Output**: Detailed analysis with:
- Root cause identification
- Code locations needing fixes
- Data consistency issues
- Security implications

### 3. Fix Implementation
```bash
/fix:hard "session timeout causing login issues"
```

**What happens**:
- **Debugger Agent** implements the fix
- **Code Reviewer Agent** reviews fix quality
- **Security Agent** validates security implications
- **Database Admin Agent** handles data corrections if needed

**Types of Fixes**:
- Code logic corrections
- Configuration updates
- Database migrations
- Security patches
- Performance optimizations

### 4. Comprehensive Testing
```bash
/fix:test
```

**What happens**:
- **Tester Agent** writes regression tests
- **Debugger Agent** verifies fix effectiveness
- **Performance Agent** checks for regressions
- Runs comprehensive test suite

**Test Coverage**:
- Unit tests for fixed code
- Integration tests for affected flows
- Regression tests for related functionality
- Performance benchmarks
- Security tests

### 5. Validation & Deployment
```bash
/fix:ci "validate fix doesn't break production"
/git:cm
```

**What happens**:
- **Debugger Agent** validates fix in staging
- **CI/CD Agent** ensures pipeline passes
- **Git Manager Agent** commits with proper format
- Monitors for any post-deployment issues

## Real Example

Let's debug a production authentication issue:

### Step 1: Investigate
```bash
/debug "users getting logged out randomly in production"
```

**Investigation Results**:
- Issue: Session tokens expiring prematurely
- Frequency: Affects 15% of users
- Impact: Users lose work session
- Pattern: Happens after 5 minutes of inactivity

### Step 2: Analyze
```bash
/debug "session configuration and cookie settings"
```

**Root Cause Analysis**:
- Session timeout set to 5 minutes instead of 24 hours
- Cookie configuration missing secure flags
- Redis session store connection issues
- Load balancer stripping session headers

### Step 3: Fix
```bash
/fix:hard "session timeout and cookie configuration"
```

**Fixes Applied**:
```javascript
// Updated session configuration
const sessionConfig = {
  maxAge: 24 * 60 * 60 * 1000, // 24 hours
  secure: true,
  httpOnly: true,
  sameSite: 'strict'
}
```

### Step 4: Test
```bash
/fix:test
```

**Tests Created**:
- Session duration tests
- Cookie security tests
- Load balancer session persistence tests
- Redis connection failover tests

### Step 5: Deploy
```bash
/fix:ci
/git:cm
```

## Specialized Debugging Commands

### CI/CD Issues
```bash
/fix:ci "failing GitHub Actions for test suite"
```
- Fixes pipeline configuration
- Resolves dependency conflicts
- Updates test commands

### Type Errors
```bash
/fix:types "TypeScript errors in user service"
```
- Fixes type definitions
- Resolves interface mismatches
- Updates type annotations

### Performance Issues
```bash
/debug "slow API response times in user endpoints"
/fix "implement database query optimization"
```

### Security Issues
```bash
/debug "potential XSS vulnerability in comment system"
/fix:hard "sanitize user input and implement CSP"
```

## Debugging Best Practices

### Before Starting
1. **Gather Context**: Collect error logs, user reports, reproduction steps
2. **Narrow Scope**: Be specific about the issue in your command
3. **Check Environment**: Verify if it's dev, staging, or production

### During Investigation
1. **Document Everything**: Keep track of findings and hypotheses
2. **Test Hypotheses**: Validate each potential cause
3. **Consider Dependencies**: Check external services and integrations

### When Implementing Fixes
1. **Minimum Changes**: Fix only what's necessary
2. **Add Tests**: Prevent regression with comprehensive tests
3. **Review Security**: Ensure fixes don't introduce vulnerabilities

### After Deployment
1. **Monitor**: Watch for related issues
2. **Document**: Update knowledge base
3. **Communicate**: Inform stakeholders about resolution

## Troubleshooting Debugging

### Common Debugging Challenges
- **Cannot Reproduce**: Use `/debug "analyze logs for pattern"`
- **Intermittent Issues**: Use `/debug "setup monitoring and logging"`
- **Performance Issues**: Use `/debug "profile application performance"`
- **Memory Leaks**: Use `/debug "analyze memory usage patterns"`

### Advanced Debugging
```bash
/debug "comprehensive system health check"
# Analyzes entire application stack

/debug "security vulnerability assessment"
# Performs security audit

/fix:hard "complete system optimization"
# Implements multiple performance improvements
```

### Zero-Effort Commands

Thay vì làm từng bước, dùng commands tự động:

| Gõ lệnh | Agent tự động làm |
|---------|-------------------|
| `/plan` | Tự tạo implementation plan |
| `/code` | Tự implement theo plan |
| `/ship` | Tự test, review, deploy |
