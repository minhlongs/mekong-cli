# /cook:auto

---

## 🤖 Quick Execute

```
Execute: https://agencyos.network/docs/commands/core/cook-auto
```



Implement a feature automatically with planning, coding, and optional commit.

## Syntax

```bash
/cook:auto [tasks]
```

## Workflow

1. **Plan**: `/plan <detailed-instruction>` creates implementation plan
2. **Code**: `/code <plan>` implements the plan
3. **Commit**: Asks user if they want to commit, triggers `/git:cm`

## Example

```bash
/cook:auto [add user authentication with JWT]

# Workflow:
# 1. Creates plan at plans/YYYYMMDD-HHmm-auth/
# 2. Implements authentication
# 3. Runs tests
# 4. Code review
# 5. Asks: "Want to commit?" → /git:cm
```

## Comparison

| Command | Planning | Testing | Commit |
|---------|----------|---------|--------|
| `/cook` | Internal | Yes | No |
| `/cook:auto` | `/plan` | Yes | Ask user |
| `/cook:auto:fast` | `/plan:fast` | Yes | No |

## When to Use

- Feature needs explicit plan
- Want plan saved for reference
- Need user approval before commit

## When to Use /cook Instead

- Simple features
- Don't need saved plan
- Faster iteration

---

**Key Takeaway**: Use `/cook:auto` when you want explicit planning with saved plan files before implementation.
