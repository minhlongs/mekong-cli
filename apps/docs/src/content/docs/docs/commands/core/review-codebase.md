# /review:codebase

---

## 🤖 Quick Execute

```
Execute: https://agencyos.network/docs/commands/core/review-codebase
```



Multi-agent codebase analysis command. Scans your entire codebase using researcher, scout, and code-reviewer agents to assess quality, identify technical debt, and create an improvement roadmap.

## Syntax

```bash
/review:codebase [tasks-or-prompt]
```

## When to Use

- **Onboarding**: Understanding a new codebase
- **Pre-Refactoring**: Assessing before major changes
- **Technical Debt Audit**: Identifying debt inventory
- **Architecture Review**: Evaluating current patterns
- **Quality Check**: Comprehensive code quality assessment

## Quick Example

```bash
/review:codebase
```

**Output**:
```
Starting codebase review...

Phase 1: Structure Scan
Analyzing directory structure...
Found: 234 files, 18 directories

Phase 2: Multi-Agent Exploration

```

## Arguments

- `[tasks-or-prompt]`: Optional focus area. If empty, reviews entire codebase.

## Agents Orchestrated

The `/review:codebase` command orchestrates **5+ agents** in parallel and sequential phases:

| Agent | Role | Usage |
|-------|------|-------|
| [scout](/docs/agents/scout) | **Parallel (x5)** - Explore different directories simultaneously |
| [researcher](/docs/agents/researcher) | Analyze architecture patterns and best practices |
| [code-reviewer](/docs/agents/code-reviewer) | Quality assessment and standards compliance |
| [planner](/docs/agents/planner) | Create improvement roadmap |
| [database-admin](/docs/agents/database-admin) | Database schema and query analysis (when applicable) |

**Total agents**: Up to 5 parallel scouts + 3-4 specialists = **8-9 agents**

### Workflow

**Step 1: Scan Directory Structure**

```
Scanning codebase...

src/
├── components/ (42 files)
├── hooks/ (12 files)
├── services/ (18 files)
├── utils/ (8 files)
└── pages/ (24 files)

Total: 234 files across 18 directories
```

**Step 2: Dispatch Scout Agents**

Five parallel scouts explore different areas:

```
Scout 1: src/components/**
Scout 2: src/hooks/** + src/utils/**
Scout 3: src/services/**
Scout 4: src/pages/**
Scout 5: tests/** + config files
```

**Step 3: Researcher Analyzes Patterns**

```
Analyzing architecture patterns...

Detected:
- Pattern: Feature-based organization
- State: Zustand stores per feature
- API: REST with React Query
- Styling: Tailwind CSS + CSS modules
```

**Step 4: Code-Reviewer Checks Quality**

```
Quality assessment...

Code Quality Metrics:
- Complexity: Medium (avg cyclomatic: 8)
- Duplication: Low (2.3%)
- Test Coverage: 67%
- Type Safety: High (strict mode)

Issues Found:
- 3 potential security issues
- 12 code style violations
- 5 performance concerns
```

**Step 5: Planner Creates Roadmap**

```
Creating improvement roadmap...

Priority 1 (Critical):
- Fix security issues in auth module
- Add input validation to API endpoints

Priority 2 (High):
- Increase test coverage to 80%
- Refactor complex components

Priority 3 (Medium):
- Address code style violations
- Optimize bundle size
```

**Step 6: Generate Report**

Comprehensive markdown report created.

## Focused Review

Specify an area for targeted analysis:

```bash
# Security focus
/review:codebase [security audit of authentication system]

# Performance focus
/review:codebase [identify performance bottlenecks]

# Testing focus
/review:codebase [assess test coverage gaps]

# Architecture focus
/review:codebase [evaluate microservices boundaries]
```

## Best Practices

### Run Before Major Changes

```bash
# Before refactoring
/review:codebase

# Review report
cat plans/reports/codebase-review-*.md

# Then plan
/plan [refactor based on review findings]
```

### Regular Health Checks

Run periodically for ongoing projects:

```bash
# Monthly health check
/review:codebase [monthly quality assessment]
```

### Focus When Needed

```bash
# Full review for new projects
/review:codebase

# Focused review for specific concerns
/review:codebase [API security]
```
