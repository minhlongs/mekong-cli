## 🤖 Quick Execute

```
Execute: https://agencyos.network/docs/commands/git/pull-request
```



Create a pull request with an AI-generated comprehensive summary and test plan. Analyzes all commits since branch divergence, reviews complete change set, and generates professional PR description using GitHub CLI.

## Syntax

```bash
/git:pr [target-branch] [source-branch]
```

### Parameters

- `[target-branch]` (optional): Branch to merge into (defaults to `main`)
- `[source-branch]` (optional): Branch to merge from (defaults to current branch)

## How It Works

The `/git:pr` command uses the `git-manager` agent with this workflow:

### 1. Branch Analysis

- Identifies target and source branches
- Checks branch tracking and remote status
- Determines divergence point from base branch
- Reviews all commits since divergence

### 2. Change Review

- Runs `git status` to see current state
- Runs `git diff` for staged/unstaged changes
- Runs `git log` to review commit history
- Runs `git diff [base]...HEAD` for complete changeset
- Analyzes ALL commits (not just latest)

### 3. PR Summary Generation

- Reviews complete diff and commit messages
- Identifies feature additions, bug fixes, refactoring
- Creates bullet-point summary of changes
- Generates test plan checklist
- Follows professional PR format

### 4. PR Creation

- Creates/pushes branch if needed
- Executes `gh pr create` with generated content
- Returns PR URL for review
- Handles authentication and permissions

## When to Use

### ✅ Perfect For

**Feature Completion**
```bash
# After implementing feature
/git:pr
```

**Bug Fix Ready**
```bash
# After fixing and testing bug
/git:pr main hotfix/critical-bug
```

**Release Preparation**
```bash
# Merge develop to main
/git:pr main develop
```

**Code Review Request**
```bash
# Request team review
/git:pr
```

### ❌ Don't Use For

**Work in Progress**
```bash
❌ /git:pr  # Before feature is complete
✅ Finish feature first, then create PR
```

**No Commits**
```bash
❌ /git:pr  # Nothing committed yet
✅ /git:cm  # Commit first
```

**GitHub CLI Not Installed**
```bash
❌ /git:pr
✅ Install gh: brew install gh
```

## Summary

### OAuth2 Implementation
- Implement OAuth2 authentication flow with authorization code grant
- Add Google OAuth provider with profile data retrieval
- Add GitHub OAuth provider with email and profile access
- Create token management system with secure storage

### User Experience
- Allow account linking for existing users
- Implement seamless signup flow for new users via OAuth
- Add OAuth disconnect functionality in account settings

### Security Enhancements
- Implement PKCE for OAuth flow security
- Add CSRF protection for OAuth callbacks
- Secure token storage with encryption
- Add rate limiting for OAuth endpoints

### Infrastructure
- Create OAuth callback endpoints
- Implement OAuth state management
- Add comprehensive error handling
- Include extensive test coverage (94%)

## Breaking Changes

- Authentication flow now requires `AUTH_CALLBACK_URL` environment variable
- Users table schema updated with OAuth fields (migration required)

## Migration Guide

1. Add environment variables:
   ```
   GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=...
   GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET=...
   GITHUB_CLIENT_ID=...
   GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET=...
   AUTH_CALLBACK_URL=https://yourdomain.com/auth/callback
   ```

2. Run database migration:
   ```
   npm run migrate
   ```

## Test plan

### OAuth Flow
- [ ] Test Google OAuth signup flow
- [ ] Test GitHub OAuth signup flow
- [ ] Test Google OAuth login flow
- [ ] Test GitHub OAuth login flow
- [ ] Verify OAuth callback handling

### Account Linking
- [ ] Test linking Google account to existing user
- [ ] Test linking GitHub account to existing user
- [ ] Verify unlinking OAuth accounts
- [ ] Test multiple OAuth providers per user

### Security
- [ ] Verify PKCE implementation
- [ ] Test CSRF protection
- [ ] Validate token encryption
- [ ] Test rate limiting
- [ ] Security audit of OAuth flow

### Edge Cases
- [ ] Test OAuth with invalid credentials
- [ ] Test OAuth callback errors
- [ ] Test concurrent OAuth attempts
- [ ] Verify expired token handling

### Integration
- [ ] Run full test suite (npm test)
- [ ] Test in staging environment
- [ ] Verify database migrations
- [ ] Check error logging and monitoring

## Best Practices

### Commit Before Creating PR

✅ **Good - Everything committed:**
```bash
# Commit all work
/git:cm

# Push to remote
git push

# Create PR
/git:pr
```

❌ **Bad - Uncommitted changes:**
```bash
# Has uncommitted changes
/git:pr  # May not include all changes
```

### Provide Branch Context

✅ **Explicit branches:**
```bash
# Merge hotfix to main
/git:pr main hotfix/critical-bug

# Merge feature to develop
/git:pr develop feature/new-api
```

### Review Before Merging

✅ **Review the PR:**
```bash
# Create PR
/git:pr

# Review on GitHub
# Get team feedback
# Address comments
# Then merge
```

## Workflow

### Feature Development Flow

```bash
# 1. Create feature branch
git checkout -b feature/user-dashboard

# 2. Implement feature (multiple commits)
/cook [add dashboard layout]
/git:cm

/cook [add dashboard widgets]
/git:cm

/cook [add dashboard filters]
/git:cm

# 3. Run tests
/test

# 4. Create PR
/git:pr

# 5. Address review feedback
# ... make changes ...
/git:cm
git push

# 6. Merge on GitHub after approval
```

### Hotfix Flow

```bash
# 1. Create hotfix branch from main
git checkout main
git pull
git checkout -b hotfix/payment-bug

# 2. Fix issue
/fix:fast [payment processing bug]

# 3. Test fix
/test

# 4. Commit
/git:cm

# 5. Create PR immediately
/git:pr main hotfix/payment-bug

# 6. Request urgent review
# 7. Merge and deploy ASAP
```

### Release Flow

```bash
# 1. Ensure develop is clean
git checkout develop
git pull

# 2. Update version and changelog
# Edit package.json and CHANGELOG.md
/git:cm

# 3. Create release PR
/git:pr main develop

# 4. Review changes thoroughly
# 5. Run full test suite in staging
# 6. Merge to main
# 7. Tag release
git tag v2.1.0
git push --tags
```

## Troubleshooting

### GitHub CLI Not Installed

**Problem:** `gh` command not found

**Solution:**
```bash
# Install GitHub CLI
brew install gh  # macOS
sudo apt install gh  # Linux

# Authenticate
gh auth login

# Retry
/git:pr
```

### Not Authenticated

**Problem:** GitHub authentication required

**Solution:**
```bash
# Authenticate with GitHub
gh auth login

# Follow prompts to authenticate

# Retry
/git:pr
```

### No Commits Ahead

**Problem:** Current branch has no new commits

**Solution:**
```bash
# Check branch status
git status
git log main..HEAD

# Ensure you have commits
# Or create new feature first
```

### Branch Not Pushed

**Problem:** Local branch not on remote

**Solution:**
```bash
# Command automatically pushes
/git:pr

# Or push manually first
git push -u origin feature-branch
/git:pr
```

### PR Already Exists

**Problem:** PR already exists for branch

**Solution:**
```bash
# View existing PR
gh pr view

# Or close old PR and create new one
gh pr close 42
/git:pr
```

## Metrics

Typical `/git:pr` performance:

- **Time**: 30 seconds - 2 minutes (depending on changeset size)
- **Commits analyzed**: All commits since branch divergence
- **Summary quality**: Professional, comprehensive
- **Test plan coverage**: Typically 8-15 checklist items
- **Success rate**: 99%+ (assuming gh CLI configured)

## Next Steps

After using `/git:pr`:

- Review PR on GitHub
- Address reviewer feedback
- Run CI/CD pipeline
- Merge when approved
- [/watzup](/docs/commands/core/watzup) - Review what was accomplished
