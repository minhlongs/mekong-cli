Analyze existing content and optimize it for conversion. This command uses conversion rate optimization (CRO) best practices, psychological triggers, and A/B testing strategies to improve your copy's effectiveness.

## Syntax

```bash
/content:cro [content issues or URL]
```

## How It Works

The `/content:cro` command follows a data-driven optimization workflow:

### 1. Content Analysis

- Reads existing content (from file, URL, or description)
- Identifies conversion goals (signup, purchase, download, etc.)
- Analyzes current messaging and CTAs
- Maps user journey and friction points

### 2. Psychological Analysis

- Identifies psychological triggers used (or missing)
- Analyzes emotional resonance
- Evaluates trust signals
- Checks for cognitive biases leveraged

### 3. CRO Audit

Invokes **copywriter** agent to audit:
- Headlines and value propositions
- Call-to-action effectiveness
- Social proof and testimonials
- Urgency and scarcity elements
- Visual hierarchy and flow
- Mobile optimization

### 4. Optimization Recommendations

Provides specific improvements:
- Rewritten headlines (3-5 variations)
- Improved CTAs
- Added psychological triggers
- Enhanced social proof
- Optimized user flow

### 5. A/B Testing Strategy

Creates testing plan:
- Test variations
- Metrics to track
- Sample size requirements
- Expected lift predictions

## Examples

### Landing Page Optimization

```bash
/content:cro [analyze landing page at https://example.com/signup]
```

**What happens:**
```
1. Content Analysis
   Agent: copywriter

   Current State:
   - Headline: "Sign up for our app"

   - Benefits listed but not compelling
   - No urgency elements

2. Psychological Analysis
   Missing triggers:
   - Loss aversion
   - Social proof
   - Scarcity/urgency
   - Authority signals

## Troubleshooting

### Low Conversion Despite Optimization

**Check:**
- Is offer compelling?
- Is pricing competitive?
- Does product match promise?
- Is traffic qualified?

**Solution:**
```bash
# Analyze deeper issues
/content:cro [full funnel analysis including traffic sources]
```

### A/B Test Shows No Winner

**Possible reasons:**
- Sample size too small
- Change too subtle
- Test run too short
- Traffic quality issues

**Solution:**
```
- Extend test duration
- Increase traffic
- Test bigger changes
- Segment results by traffic source
```

## Next Steps

After optimization:

```bash
# 1. Analyze content
/content:cro [page description]

# 2. Review recommendations
cat plans/content-cro-*.md

# 3. Implement changes
/cook [implement CRO recommendations]

# 4. Set up A/B tests
# (Use your testing platform)

# 5. Monitor results
# Track metrics for 2-4 weeks

# 6. Iterate
