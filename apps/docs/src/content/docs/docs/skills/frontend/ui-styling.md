## Common Use Cases

### Landing Page Hero

CTA buttons (primary + secondary), and a product screenshot card.
Mobile-responsive with Tailwind."
```

### Admin Dashboard
**Who**: Backend dev needing quick admin UI
```
"Build a dashboard layout: sidebar nav (collapsible on mobile), header with
user dropdown, main content area with stats cards showing metrics (users, revenue,
orders). Use shadcn components and chart library."
```

### Form Wizard
**Who**: Product manager prototyping onboarding flow
```
"Create a 3-step signup wizard with progress indicator. Step 1: email/password,
Step 2: profile info (name, avatar upload), Step 3: preferences (checkboxes).
Add validation with error messages."
```

### Design Assets
**Who**: Startup founder needing event poster
```
"Generate a visual design for our launch event - bold geometric shapes,
company colors (blue/purple gradient), date/location minimal text.
Museum-quality aesthetic, canvas-based."
```

### E-commerce Product Page
**Who**: Frontend dev building shop UI
```
"Create a product page: image gallery with thumbnails, title, price,
size selector (radio buttons), quantity input, Add to Cart button,
collapsible description tabs. Dark mode support."
```

## Pro Tips

- **Setup shortcut**: Run `npx shadcn@latest init` once per project - configures both shadcn and Tailwind
- **Mobile-first**: Always start with base mobile styles, add `md:` and `lg:` prefixes for larger screens
- **Dark mode**: Use `dark:` prefix for all themed elements (`dark:bg-gray-900`, `dark:text-white`)
- **Avoid dynamic classes**: Use full class names (`bg-blue-500` not `bg-${color}-500`) for Tailwind purge
- **Component variants**: Customize in `components/ui/*.tsx` for project-wide consistency
- **Not activating?** Say: **"Use ui-styling skill to build this interface with shadcn and Tailwind"**
