## Quick Start

npm install -g @shopify/cli@latest

# Verify
shopify version
```

shopify app dev          # Local development
shopify app deploy       # Production deploy
```

**Create Theme:**
```bash
shopify theme init
shopify theme dev        # Preview at localhost:9292
shopify theme push       # Deploy to store
```

## Core Patterns

### GraphQL Product Query
```graphql
query {
  products(first: 10) {
    edges {
      node {
        id
        title
        variants(first: 5) {
          edges {
            node {
              id
              price
              inventoryQuantity
            }
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Checkout Extension
```javascript
import { reactExtension, BlockStack, TextField } from '@shopify/ui-extensions-react/checkout';

export default reactExtension('purchase.checkout.block.render', () => <Extension />);

function Extension() {
  return (
    <BlockStack>
      <TextField label="Gift Message" />
    </BlockStack>
  );
}
```

### Handle Webhooks
```javascript
app.post('/webhooks/orders', async (req, res) => {
  const hmac = req.headers['x-shopify-hmac-sha256'];
  const verified = verifyWebhook(req.body, hmac);

  if (verified) {
    const order = req.body;
    // Process order
  }

  res.status(200).send();
});
```

## Pro Tips

- **Use GraphQL over REST** for new development (better performance, cost-based limits)
- **Request minimal scopes** in OAuth to pass app review faster
- **Implement retry logic** for API calls with exponential backoff
- **Cache API responses** to reduce costs and improve speed
- **Test on development stores** (free via Partner Dashboard)
- **Monitor rate limits** via `X-Shopify-Shop-Api-Call-Limit` header
- **Use bulk operations** for processing 1000+ resources
- **Verify webhook signatures** with HMAC to prevent spoofing
- **Not activating?** Say: "Use shopify skill to..."
