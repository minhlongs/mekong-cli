# /skill:create

Create new agent skills that extend Claude's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. This command follows a comprehensive 4-phase process: research, implementation, review, and evaluation.

## Syntax

```bash
/skill:create [prompt-or-llms-or-github-url]
```

## Input Types

### 1. Natural Language Prompt

```bash
/skill:create [create skill for MongoDB database operations]
```

### 2. llms.txt URL

```bash
/skill:create https://docs.paypal.sh/llms.txt
```

### 3. GitHub Repository

```bash
/skill:create https://github.com/cloudflare/workers-sdk
```

## How It Works

The `/skill:create` command follows a 4-phase workflow:

### Phase 1: Research (2-3 minutes)

Invokes **researcher** agent to:
- Fetch documentation (llms.txt, GitHub, web)
- Analyze domain knowledge required
- Identify key concepts and patterns
- Map out skill structure
- Determine MCP integration needs
- Research best practices

### Phase 2: Implementation (3-5 minutes)

Invokes **skill-creator** agent to:
- Write skill prompt file
- Structure knowledge sections
- Create usage examples
- Define when to use skill
- Add tool integration instructions
- Include best practices
- Format in markdown

### Phase 3: Review (1-2 minutes)

Invokes **code-reviewer** agent to:
- Validate skill structure
- Check completeness
- Verify examples work
- Ensure clear instructions
- Validate formatting
- Suggest improvements

### Phase 4: Evaluation (1 minute)

Invokes **tester** agent to:
- Test skill activation
- Verify skill prompt loads
- Check examples are clear
- Validate tool integrations
- Test edge cases
- Generate usage report

```

❌ **Vague:**
```bash
/skill:create [websockets]
```

### Use Official Documentation

```bash
# Best: Official llms.txt
/skill:create https://docs.service.com/llms.txt

# Good: Official GitHub
/skill:create https://github.com/official/repo

# OK: Natural language (but less comprehensive)
/skill:create [create skill for X]
```

### Specify Domain if Broad

```bash
# Too broad
/skill:create [Python]

# Better
/skill:create [Python async programming with asyncio]

# Best
/skill:create [Python async programming with asyncio including event loops, coroutines, async/await patterns, and concurrent task management]
```

## After Skill Creation

```bash
# 1. Create skill
/skill:create [description or URL]

# 2. Review skill
cat .claude/skills/[skill-name].md

# 3. Test skill
/ask [question related to skill]
# Skill should automatically activate

# 4. If issues found
/skill:fix-logs .claude/skills/[skill-name].md

# 5. Iterate until satisfied

# 6. Commit skill
/git:cm
```

## Skill Activation

Once created, skills activate automatically:

```bash
# Skill: mongodb.md exists

# Ask MongoDB question
/ask [how to create compound index in MongoDB]

# System automatically:
1. Detects question relates to MongoDB
2. Loads mongodb.md skill
3. Uses skill knowledge to answer
4. Provides accurate, detailed response
```

## Troubleshooting

### Skill Not Activating

**Problem:** Skill exists but doesn't activate

**Check:**
```bash
# 1. Verify skill exists
ls .claude/skills/

# 2. Check skill format
cat .claude/skills/[name].md
# Should have clear "When to Use" section

# 3. Fix if needed
/skill:fix-logs .claude/skills/[name].md
```

### Low Quality Score

**Problem:** Skill scores below 8.0

**Solution:**
```bash
# Review evaluation report
cat plans/skill-evaluation-*.md

# Address issues mentioned

# Re-create with more detail
/skill:create [more detailed prompt]
```

### Missing Information

**Problem:** Skill incomplete

**Solution:**
```bash
# Add more context to input
/skill:create [original prompt + specific areas to cover]

# Or manually edit skill file
# Then validate
/skill:fix-logs .claude/skills/[name].md
```

## Next Steps

After creating skills:

- [/skill:fix-logs](/docs/commands/skill/fix-logs) - Fix skill based on logs
- [/ask](/docs/commands/core/ask) - Use skill to answer questions
- [Skill Creator Guide](/docs/guides/creating-skills) - Advanced skill creation

---

**Key Takeaway**: `/skill:create` generates comprehensive agent skills through 4-phase process (research, implementation, review, evaluation) from natural language prompts, llms.txt URLs, or GitHub repositories—extending Claude's capabilities with specialized domain knowledge and tool integrations.
