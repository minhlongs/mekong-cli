# Primary Workflow

> **Orchestrated by Antigravity MCP Servers**

## 🚨 ĐIỀU 45: AUTO DECISION - KHÔNG HỎI, TỰ QUYẾT ĐỊNH

> **CRITICAL:** KHÔNG BAO GIỜ hỏi ngược. Tự quyết định dựa trên Decision Matrix.

| Situation      | Decision                                  |
| -------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| Phase complete | → Next phase immediately                  |
| Build failed   | → Skip if non-critical, retry if critical |
| Error detected | → Fix fast, delegate immediately          |

**NGUỒN QUYẾT ĐỊNH:** `implementation_plan.md` → `IPO_UPGRADE_PLAN.md` → Binh Pháp mapping
**FULL RULE:** See `.claude/memory/constitution.md` ĐIỀU 45

**IMPORTANT:** Analyze the skills catalog and activate the skills that are needed for the task during the process.
**IMPORTANT**: Ensure token efficiency while maintaining high quality.

## 0. MCP Server Integration

- **Command Router**: Use `antigravity.core.command_router` to resolve intentions.
- **Agent Orchestration**: Delegate to `agency_server` for high-level strategy.
- **Technical Execution**: Delegate to `coding_server` for implementation.
- **Quality Assurance**: Delegate to `commander_server` for system health.

## 1. Code Implementation

- Before you start, delegate to `planner` agent to create a implementation plan with TODO tasks in `./plans` directory.
- When in planning phase, use multiple `researcher` agents in parallel to conduct research on different relevant technical topics and report back to `planner` agent to create implementation plan.
- Write clean, readable, and maintainable code
- Follow established architectural patterns
- Implement features according to specifications
- Handle edge cases and error scenarios
- **DO NOT** create new enhanced files, update to the existing files directly.
- **[IMPORTANT]** After creating or modifying code file, run compile command/script to check for any compile errors.

## 2. Testing

- Delegate to `tester` agent to run tests and analyze the summary report.
    - Write comprehensive unit tests
    - Ensure high code coverage
    - Test error scenarios
    - Validate performance requirements
- Tests are critical for ensuring code quality and reliability, **DO NOT** ignore failing tests just to pass the build.
- **IMPORTANT:** make sure you don't use fake data, mocks, cheats, tricks, temporary solutions, just to pass the build or github actions.
- **IMPORTANT:** Always fix failing tests follow the recommendations and delegate to `tester` agent to run tests again, only finish your session when all tests pass.

## 3. Code Quality

- After finish implementation, delegate to `code-reviewer` agent to review code.
- Follow coding standards and conventions
- Write self-documenting code
- Add meaningful comments for complex logic
- Optimize for performance and maintainability

## 4. Integration

- Always follow the plan given by `planner` agent
- Ensure seamless integration with existing code
- Follow API contracts precisely
- Maintain backward compatibility
- Document breaking changes
- Delegate to `docs-manager` agent to update docs in `./docs` directory if any.

## 5. Debugging

- When a user report bugs or issues on the server or a CI/CD pipeline, delegate to `debugger` agent to run tests and analyze the summary report.
- Read the summary report from `debugger` agent and implement the fix.
- Delegate to `tester` agent to run tests and analyze the summary report.
- If the `tester` agent reports failed tests, fix them follow the recommendations and repeat from the **Step 2**.
