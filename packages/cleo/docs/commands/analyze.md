# analyze Command

Smart task triage and prioritization using leverage scoring, bottleneck detection, and domain grouping.

## Usage

```bash
cleo analyze [OPTIONS]
```

## Description

The `analyze` command provides intelligent task prioritization by calculating leverage scores, identifying bottlenecks, grouping tasks by domain, and recommending an optimal action order. It combines multiple analysis dimensions to help LLM agents and users make data-driven decisions about what to work on next.

**Default output is LLM-optimized JSON** designed for autonomous agent consumption. Use `--human` for human-readable text output.

This command is particularly useful for:
- **LLM agents**: Token-efficient structured JSON with all analysis data for autonomous task selection
- **Decision paralysis**: Data-driven task prioritization when multiple options exist
- **Project planning**: Understanding dependency chains and bottlenecks
- **Impact assessment**: Identifying which tasks unlock the most downstream work

## Algorithm

### 1. Hierarchy-Aware Leverage Score Calculation

Leverage measures downstream impact with hierarchy-aware weighting. Dependencies are weighted based on their relationship type:

| Relationship | Weight | Rationale |
|--------------|--------|-----------|
| Parent→Child | 0.3x | Same scope, less strategic impact |
| Same Epic | 1.0x | Standard true blockers |
| Cross-Phase | 1.5x | Phase alignment = higher strategic value |

The leverage score formula incorporates multiple multipliers:

```
weighted_unlocks = Σ(weight_for_each_blocked_task)
base_score = floor(weighted_unlocks * 15) + priority_score
leverage_score = floor(base_score * phase_boost * size_weight)
```

**Components**:
- **Priority Score**: Task's intrinsic priority (critical=100, high=75, medium=50, low=25)
- **Weighted Unlocks**: Sum of dependency weights for all blocked tasks
- **Phase Boost**: Multiplier based on task-project phase alignment (see Phase Boost section)
- **Size Weight**: Multiplier based on task size and strategy (see Size Weighting section)

**Examples**:
```
Task T312 (high priority) blocks 4 cross-phase tasks
weighted_unlocks = 4 * 1.5 = 6.0
Leverage Score = floor(6.0 * 15) + 75 = 90 + 75 = 165

Task T001 (epic) blocks 3 child tasks
weighted_unlocks = 3 * 0.3 = 0.9
Leverage Score = floor(0.9 * 15) + 75 = 13 + 75 = 88
```

**Configuration** (via config.json):
```json
{
  "analyze": {
    "hierarchyWeight": {
      "parentChild": 0.3,
      "crossEpic": 1.0,
      "crossPhase": 1.5
    }
  }
}
```

### Size Weighting

Size weighting allows prioritization based on task size using configurable strategies:

| Strategy | small | medium | large | Use Case |
|----------|-------|--------|-------|----------|
| `quick-wins` | 3x | 2x | 1x | Build momentum with small tasks |
| `big-impact` | 1x | 2x | 3x | Prioritize high-impact large tasks |
| `balanced` | 1x | 1x | 1x | Neutral (default) |

**Configuration** (via config.json):
```json
{
  "analyze": {
    "sizeStrategy": "balanced",
    "sizeWeights": {
      "small": 1.0,
      "medium": 1.0,
      "large": 1.0
    }
  }
}
```

**Example with quick-wins strategy**:
```
Task T001 (small, high priority) - size_weight = 3
base_score = 75, leverage_score = 75 * 1.0 * 3 = 225

Task T002 (large, high priority) - size_weight = 1
base_score = 75, leverage_score = 75 * 1.0 * 1 = 75
```

### 2. Actionable vs Blocked Detection

Tasks are classified as **actionable** if all their dependencies are satisfied (status=done).

```json
{
  "is_actionable": true,   // All deps completed
  "blocked_by": []         // Empty - no blockers
}
```

Blocked tasks have unsatisfied dependencies:
```json
{
  "is_actionable": false,
  "blocked_by": ["T312", "T204"]  // Waiting on these
}
```

### 3. Bottleneck Detection

Bottlenecks are tasks that block 2+ other tasks:

```bash
T312 blocks: T316, T317, T318... (11 total) -> CRITICAL BOTTLENECK
T204 blocks: T215, T216, T217... (7 total)  -> HIGH BOTTLENECK
```

### 4. Tier Assignment

Tasks are automatically grouped into action tiers based on leverage and actionability:

| Tier | Criteria | Action |
|------|----------|--------|
| **Tier 1: Unblock** | Actionable AND unlocks 3+ tasks | Start immediately |
| **Tier 2: Critical** | Actionable AND (critical OR high priority) | Prioritize next |
| **Tier 3: Blocked** | Has unsatisfied dependencies | Wait for blockers |
| **Tier 4: Routine** | Actionable AND (medium OR low priority) | Normal queue |

### 5. Domain Grouping

Tasks are dynamically grouped by their labels to identify thematic clusters:

```json
{
  "domains": [
    {"domain": "feature-phase", "count": 12, "actionable_count": 8},
    {"domain": "hierarchy", "count": 22, "actionable_count": 1},
    {"domain": "testing", "count": 10, "actionable_count": 3}
  ]
}
```

## Options

| Option | Short | Description | Default |
|--------|-------|-------------|---------|
| `--parent ID` | | Scope analysis to epic/task and all descendants | (project-wide) |
| `--human` | | Human-readable text output | (JSON) |
| `--full` | | Comprehensive human-readable report | (JSON) |
| `--auto-focus` | | Automatically set focus to top recommendation | `false` |
| `--help` | `-h` | Show help message | |

## Epic-Scoped Analysis (`--parent`)

The `--parent` flag enables epic-scoped analysis, providing detailed breakdown of an epic and all its children. This is particularly useful for:

- Understanding epic progress across phases
- Identifying ready vs blocked tasks within an epic
- Planning execution waves for parallel work
- Finding the critical path through the epic

### Usage

```bash
# JSON output (default for LLM agents)
cleo analyze --parent T998

# Human-readable output
cleo analyze --parent T998 --human
```

### Wave Computation

Waves represent the parallel execution order based on dependency depth:

- **Wave 0**: Tasks with no dependencies (entry points)
- **Wave N**: Tasks whose max dependency wave is N-1

Waves are computed within each phase, allowing you to understand the execution order even when tasks span multiple phases.

DOMAINS (by label)
  hierarchy: 1/22 actionable
  feature-phase: 8/12 actionable
  testing: 3/10 actionable
```

### Full Format (`--full`)

Comprehensive human-readable report with detailed tier breakdowns:

```bash
cleo analyze --full
```

Includes everything from `--human` plus:
- Detailed task lists for each tier
- Which tasks each bottleneck unblocks
- Which dependencies are blocking each blocked task
- Full domain breakdown with task IDs

## Use Cases

### 1. Autonomous Agent Task Selection

```bash
# LLM agent gets full analysis, selects optimal task
analysis=$(cleo analyze)
task_id=$(echo "$analysis" | jq -r '.recommendation.task_id')
cleo focus set "$task_id"
```

### 2. Autonomous Mode with Auto-Focus

```bash
# Analyze and automatically set focus to top recommendation
cleo analyze --auto-focus
```

### 3. Human Planning Session

```bash
# Get readable overview for sprint planning
cleo analyze --human

# Get detailed breakdown for deeper analysis
cleo analyze --full
```

### 4. CI/CD Health Check

```bash
# Check for bottleneck health in pipeline
analysis=$(cleo analyze)
bottleneck_count=$(echo "$analysis" | jq '.summary.bottleneck_count')
blocked_ratio=$(echo "$analysis" | jq '.summary.blocked / .summary.total_pending')

if (( $(echo "$blocked_ratio > 0.8" | bc -l) )); then
  echo "WARNING: 80%+ tasks blocked - resolve bottlenecks"
fi
```

### 5. Extract Top Action Order

```bash
# Get just the action order for quick decisions
cleo analyze | jq -r '.action_order[0:5][] | "\(.id) - \(.reason)"'
```

## Understanding the Output

### Leverage Score

Higher leverage = higher impact. Work on high-leverage tasks first:

| Score Range | Impact | Action |
|-------------|--------|--------|
| **200+** | Critical | Immediate attention |
| **100-199** | High | Next in queue |
| **50-99** | Medium | Standard priority |
| **<50** | Low | Background/defer |

### Actionable vs Blocked

- **Actionable tasks**: Ready to work on (all dependencies satisfied)
- **Blocked tasks**: Waiting on other tasks (shown in Tier 3)

Only Tier 1 and Tier 2 contain actionable tasks. Tier 3 explicitly shows what's blocking each task.

### Domain Insights

Domains are grouped by labels. Use this to:
- Identify which feature areas have work available
- See bottleneck concentration by domain
- Plan sprints around domain themes

## Comparison with Other Commands

| Command | Purpose | Use When |
|---------|---------|----------|
| **analyze** | Full triage with leverage, tiers, domains | Need strategic prioritization |
| **next** | Simple next-task suggestion | Quick "what should I do?" |
| **blockers** | Show blocked tasks and chains | Focus on unblocking |
| **deps** | Visualize dependency tree | Understand task relationships |
| **dash** | Project overview | High-level status check |

## Stale Task Detection

The analyze command includes intelligent stale task detection to identify tasks that may need review or intervention.

### Stale Indicators

| Type | Condition | Default Threshold |
|------|-----------|-------------------|
| `urgent_neglected` | High/critical priority, untouched | 7 days |
| `long_blocked` | Blocked without progress | 7 days |
| `old_pending` | Created long ago, still pending | 30 days |
| `no_updates` | No notes/activity | 14 days |

### JSON Output

Stale tasks are included in the analysis output:

```json
{
  "staleCount": 9,
  "staleTasks": [
    {
      "taskId": "T301",
      "title": "Important feature",
      "priority": "high",
      "status": "pending",
      "staleness": {
        "type": "urgent_neglected",
        "daysSinceCreated": 14,
        "daysSinceUpdate": 14,
        "reason": "HIGH priority task untouched for 14 days"
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

### Human Output

```
STALE TASKS (need review - 9 total)
  T301 [high] - HIGH priority task untouched for 14 days
  T310 [high] - HIGH priority task untouched for 14 days
  T456 [medium] - Blocked for 21 days without progress
  ... and 6 more
```

### Configuration

Configure thresholds in `config.json`:

```json
{
  "analyze": {
    "staleDetection": {
      "enabled": true,
      "pendingDays": 30,
      "noUpdateDays": 14,
      "blockedDays": 7,
      "urgentNeglectedDays": 7
    }
  }
}
```

Set `enabled: false` to disable stale detection in output.

### Epic-Scoped Staleness

When using `--parent`, stale tasks are filtered to only those within the epic scope:

```bash
cleo analyze --parent T001  # Only shows stale tasks in T001 subtree
```

## Exit Codes

| Code | Meaning |
|------|---------|
| `0` | Success |
| `1` | Error (file not found, jq missing) |
| `2` | No pending tasks to analyze |

## Version History

- **v0.42.0**: Stale task detection - identifies old pending, no updates, long blocked, and urgent neglected tasks with configurable thresholds
- **v0.41.0**: Epic-scoped analysis with `--parent` flag - phase grouping, wave computation, inventory, execution plan, human ASCII output
