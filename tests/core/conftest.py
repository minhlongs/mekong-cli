Core test conftest — undo root conftest session-level mocks.

tests/conftest.py runs `patch(...).start()` at module level for the whole
pytest session, permanently replacing real classes with MagicMock:

    src.core.scheduler.Scheduler          -> MagicMock()
    src.core.orchestrator.RecipeOrchestrator -> MagicMock()
    src.core.memory.MemoryStore           -> MagicMock()

That is correct for gateway tests (they import the real FastAPI app and
need the orchestrator stubbed so mission creation does not spin up a real
agent loop). It is wrong for the core unit tests, which construct the real
classes directly and assert on real attributes (job_count, dispatcher,
_data, OrchestrationStatus values).

Restoration runs at MODULE level here (not in a fixture) because the core
test modules do `from src.core.scheduler import Scheduler` at their top
(line 11 of test_scheduler.py), which binds the name at collection time.
A session fixture would run too late — after the test module already captured
the MagicMock. pytest collects conftest.py before the test modules in its
directory, so module-level restoration here runs first and the test modules
import the real class.

Restoration re-binds the real class onto the package attribute that
patch() mutated. patch() mutates the attribute on the *package* object
(src.core.orchestrator.__init__), not on the defining module
(src.core.orchestrator.runner), which was never patched. Importing the
defining module returns the real class; re-binding it onto the package makes
`from src.core.X import Y` in tests get the real implementation again.
