## 1. Context and Problem Statement

CLEO's BRAIN cognitive architecture is defined across **6+ scattered documents** with no single authoritative reference connecting them. This fragmentation has produced:

- **Storage contradictions**: BRAIN Spec defines JSONL memory files; ADR-006 mandates SQLite for all operational data
- **Retrieval strategy conflict**: cognitive-architecture.mdx defines "Vectorless RAG"; BRAIN Spec and Strategic Roadmap plan SQLite-vec vector embeddings
- **Pipeline stage mismatch (resolved)**: ADR-006 schema listed 9 stages with "adr" as a stage; now resolved to 9 pipeline stages + contribution cross-cutting, with `architecture_decision` replacing "adr" (see ADR-014, T4863)
- **Incomplete domain mapping**: ADR-007 Section 4.2 lists 10 future operations across 5 BRAIN dimensions; the BRAIN Spec defines 30+ operations
- **Undefined framework relationship**: The 5 Canonical Pillars (CLEO-VISION.mdx) and 5 BRAIN Dimensions (BRAIN Spec) are never formally related
- **Reasoning domain placement unresolved**: The BRAIN Spec defines `cleo reason *` commands, but no domain in ADR-007 naturally owns reasoning as a cross-cutting capability

This ADR serves as the **single bridging document** that resolves these conflicts and connects the BRAIN system across all existing specifications.

---

## 2. Decision

### 2.1 Two Orthogonal Frameworks

CLEO operates under **two complementary frameworks** at different abstraction levels:

| Framework | Authority | Abstraction | Defines | Mutability |
|-----------|-----------|-------------|---------|------------|
| **5 Canonical Pillars** | CLEO-VISION.md, CLEO-PORTABLE-PROJECT-BRAIN-SPEC.md (Part I) | Product contract | WHAT CLEO promises to users and agents | Immutable (constitutional) |
| **5 BRAIN Dimensions** | CLEO-PORTABLE-PROJECT-BRAIN-SPEC.md (Part II) | Capability model | HOW CLEO delivers on those promises | Evolves with implementation |

**The Pillars define identity. The BRAIN dimensions define capability.**

They are orthogonal: a single Pillar may be served by multiple BRAIN dimensions, and a single BRAIN dimension may contribute to multiple Pillars.

### 2.2 Pillar-to-BRAIN Crosswalk

| Pillar | Primary BRAIN Dimensions | How Delivered |
|--------|--------------------------|---------------|
| **Portable Memory** | Base (Memory), Network | Task/session persistence, cross-project knowledge transfer |
| **Provenance by Default** | Base (Memory), Intelligence | Audit trails, decision memory, compliance scoring |
| **Interoperable Interfaces** | Agent, Network | CLI + MCP + adapters, federated agent coordination |
| **Deterministic Safety** | Intelligence, Base (Memory) | 4-layer validation, adaptive validation, atomic writes |
| **Cognitive Retrieval** | Reasoning, Base (Memory), Network | Graph-RAG, vectorless hierarchy search, similarity detection, cross-project search; **ADR search shipped (T4942)**: `admin.adr.find` provides score-weighted fuzzy retrieval over the ADR decision store |

### 2.3 The 5 BRAIN Dimensions — Canonical Definition

```
B — Base (Memory Layer)
    Persistent knowledge storage and retrieval across sessions.
    The foundation all other dimensions build upon.

R — Reasoning (Inference Layer)
    Causal inference, similarity detection, impact prediction, temporal analysis.
    The analytical capability that derives insight from stored memory.

A — Agent (Orchestration Layer)
    Autonomous multi-agent coordination with self-healing and learning.
    The execution fabric that carries out work.

I — Intelligence (Validation & Adaptation Layer)
    Adaptive validation, proactive suggestions, quality prediction.
    The quality system that learns from outcomes.

N — Network (Cross-Project Coordination Layer)
    Multi-project knowledge sharing and federated agent coordination.
    The global scope that connects project-local brains.
```

**Clarification (ADR-021)**: B-R-A-I-N is an **informative conceptual lens**, not a runtime model. The 10 canonical domains (ADR-007) are the runtime contract. BRAIN dimensions help reason about capability groupings, but all operations are addressed by domain and operation name at runtime (e.g., `memory.find`, not `brain.search`).

### 2.4 BRAIN Dimension to Domain Mapping

Each BRAIN dimension maps to one or more of the 10 canonical domains (ADR-007; sharing added by ADR-015):

| BRAIN Dimension | Primary Domain | Secondary Domains | Scope |
|-----------------|---------------|-------------------|-------|
| **Base (Memory)** | `memory` | `session`, `tasks` | Project-local (.cleo/) |
| **Reasoning** | **DEFERRED** | See Section 2.5 | Project-local (.cleo/) |
| **Agent** | `orchestrate` | `tools` | Project-local (.cleo/) |
| **Intelligence** | `check` | `pipeline` | Project-local (.cleo/) |
| **Network** | `nexus` | `admin` | Global (~/.cleo/) |

### 2.5 Reasoning Domain Placement — Deferred to Research & Consensus

**DECISION**: The domain placement of Reasoning operations is **deferred** to a future RCSD cycle.

**Rationale**: CLEO is built for LLM agents, not humans. Reasoning operations (`reason why`, `reason similar`, `reason impact`, `reason timeline`) could be:

1. A subdomain of `memory` (reasoning = querying and analyzing stored knowledge)
2. A cross-cutting capability spread across `tasks`, `memory`, and `orchestrate`
3. A subdomain of `check` (reasoning = analysis and validation)
4. Something entirely different when viewed from an agent's operational perspective

This decision requires dedicated research into how LLM agents would actually invoke and benefit from reasoning operations in their workflows. Agent-native design demands evidence, not assumptions.

**Interim Approach**: Reasoning operations are documented in this ADR as belonging to the BRAIN specification but without a committed domain assignment. Existing reasoning-adjacent operations (dependency analysis in `tasks`, wave computation in `orchestrate`, similarity in `nexus`) remain where they are.

**Required Task**: Create an RCSD research task to investigate reasoning domain placement from an LLM agent workflow perspective.

---

## 3. Storage Architecture — Hybrid Model

### 3.1 Resolution of ADR-006 vs BRAIN Spec Conflict

ADR-006 (accepted) mandates SQLite for all operational data. The BRAIN Spec defines JSONL memory files. These are reconciled as follows:

**SQLite is the canonical runtime store for all BRAIN memory data.**

JSONL serves as an **export/import format** for portability, not as a runtime store.

| Memory Type | Runtime Store | Export Format | Rationale |
|-------------|--------------|---------------|-----------|
| Decision Memory | `brain_decisions` SQLite table | JSONL export | Concurrent writes, relational queries, ACID |
| Pattern Memory | `brain_patterns` SQLite table | JSONL export | Frequency analysis, cross-reference queries |
| Learning Memory | `brain_learnings` SQLite table | JSONL export | Confidence-based filtering, type queries |
| Session Context | `sessions` SQLite table (existing) | JSON export | Already in SQLite per ADR-006 |
| Research Artifacts | MANIFEST.jsonl (existing) | JSONL (native) | Append-only, agent-output format |

### 3.2 SQLite Schema Extensions for BRAIN

The following tables extend the ADR-006 Project Store schema:

```sql
-- Decision Memory (BRAIN Base dimension)
CREATE TABLE brain_decisions (
  id TEXT PRIMARY KEY,              -- e.g., 'D001'
  type TEXT NOT NULL CHECK(type IN ('architecture', 'technical', 'process', 'strategic', 'tactical')),
  decision TEXT NOT NULL,
  rationale TEXT NOT NULL,
  confidence TEXT NOT NULL CHECK(confidence IN ('low', 'medium', 'high')),
  outcome TEXT CHECK(outcome IN ('success', 'failure', 'mixed', 'pending')),
  alternatives_json TEXT,           -- JSON array of alternative approaches
  context_epic_id TEXT REFERENCES tasks(id),
  context_task_id TEXT REFERENCES tasks(id),
  context_phase TEXT,
  created_at TEXT NOT NULL,
  updated_at TEXT
);

-- Pattern Memory (BRAIN Base + Intelligence dimensions)
CREATE TABLE brain_patterns (
  id TEXT PRIMARY KEY,              -- e.g., 'P001'
  type TEXT NOT NULL CHECK(type IN ('workflow', 'blocker', 'success', 'failure', 'optimization')),
  pattern TEXT NOT NULL,
  context TEXT NOT NULL,
  frequency INTEGER NOT NULL DEFAULT 1,
  success_rate REAL,                -- 0.0-1.0 for workflow patterns
  impact TEXT CHECK(impact IN ('low', 'medium', 'high')),
  anti_pattern TEXT,
  mitigation TEXT,
  examples_json TEXT,               -- JSON array of task IDs
  extracted_at TEXT NOT NULL,
  updated_at TEXT
);

-- Learning Memory (BRAIN Base dimension)
CREATE TABLE brain_learnings (
  id TEXT PRIMARY KEY,              -- e.g., 'L001'
  insight TEXT NOT NULL,
  source TEXT NOT NULL,
  confidence REAL NOT NULL CHECK(confidence >= 0.0 AND confidence <= 1.0),
  actionable INTEGER NOT NULL DEFAULT 0,  -- boolean
  application TEXT,
  applicable_types_json TEXT,       -- JSON array of task types
  created_at TEXT NOT NULL,
  updated_at TEXT
);

-- Cross-references between BRAIN memory entries and tasks
CREATE TABLE brain_memory_links (
  memory_type TEXT NOT NULL CHECK(memory_type IN ('decision', 'pattern', 'learning')),
  memory_id TEXT NOT NULL,
  task_id TEXT NOT NULL REFERENCES tasks(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  link_type TEXT NOT NULL CHECK(link_type IN ('produced_by', 'applies_to', 'informed_by', 'contradicts')),
  created_at TEXT NOT NULL,
  PRIMARY KEY (memory_type, memory_id, task_id, link_type)
);
```

### 3.3 JSONL Export/Import for Portability

BRAIN memory data can be exported to JSONL for transfer between projects or backup:

```bash
# Export decisions to JSONL
cleo memory export --type decisions --output decisions.jsonl

# Import decisions from JSONL
cleo memory import --type decisions --input decisions.jsonl

# Export all BRAIN memory
cleo memory export --all --output brain-export/
```

This preserves portability (Pillar 1: Portable Memory) while respecting ADR-006's SQLite mandate for runtime operations.

### 3.4 Storage Evolution Path

| Tier | Storage | BRAIN Capability |
|------|---------|-----------------|
| **S** (current) | SQLite (project-local .cleo/brain.db) | Decision/Pattern/Learning tables |
| **M** (target) | SQLite + SQLite-vec (semantic embeddings) | + Similarity detection, semantic search |
| **L** (future) | SQLite + PostgreSQL (cross-project) | + Global intelligence, federated queries |
| **XL** (aspirational) | PostgreSQL + graph extensions | + Neural discovery, advanced reasoning |

---

## 4. Retrieval Architecture — Vectorless RAG + Future Vector Capability

### 4.1 Current State: Vectorless RAG

CLEO currently implements a **Vectorless RAG** system as documented in cognitive-architecture.mdx. This is not a limitation but a deliberate design choice:

```
Hierarchical Semantic Trees (current):
  Epic → Task → Subtask
       ↓
  LLM Reasoning Over Structure
       ↓
  Contextual Discovery Without Vectors
```

**Five Discovery Methods** (all vectorless):
1. **Label-based**: Jaccard similarity on shared tags
2. **Description-based**: Keyword extraction and matching
3. **File-based**: Shared code file references
4. **Hierarchy-based**: Tree distance via Lowest Common Ancestor (LCA) algorithm
5. **Auto mode**: Weighted combination with hierarchy boosting

**Neural Hierarchy**:
- Tasks act as **neurons** (atomic knowledge units)
- Dependencies act as **synapses** (directional connections)
- Hierarchy boosts act as **weights** (proximity strengthens relevance)
- Dual indexes provide O(1) lookup (forward: task->deps, reverse: task->dependents)

### 4.2 Future State: Vectorless RAG + Vector Augmentation

When SQLite-vec is introduced (Phase 2, contingent on validation gates), it **augments** the existing vectorless system rather than replacing it:

```
Query
  ├── Vectorless RAG (structural discovery)
  │   └── Hierarchy, labels, dependencies, LCA
  │
  └── Vector RAG (semantic discovery)
      └── SQLite-vec embeddings, cosine similarity

  → Merged Results (weighted by source confidence)
```

**Key Principle**: Structural discovery (vectorless) remains the **primary** retrieval method. Vector similarity is an **optional augmentation** for semantic queries that structural methods cannot answer well (e.g., "find tasks similar to authentication implementation" across unrelated hierarchies).

### 4.3 Knowledge Graph Edges

The `relates` field on tasks provides explicit knowledge graph connections:

| Edge Type | Meaning | Example |
|-----------|---------|---------|
| `relates-to` | General relationship | T100 relates-to T200 |
| `spawned-from` | Created by decomposition | T101 spawned-from T100 |
| `deferred-to` | Work moved to future task | T100 deferred-to T300 |
| `supersedes` | Replaces older task | T200 supersedes T100 |
| `duplicates` | Same work as another task | T100 duplicates T150 |

## 5. BRAIN Dimension — Full Capability Inventory

This section provides the comprehensive mapping of all BRAIN capabilities to the 9 canonical domains, resolving the gap in ADR-007 Section 4.2.

### 5.1 Base (Memory) — Domain: `memory` + `session` + `admin` (ADR store)

| Capability | Domain.Operation | Phase | Status |

| **ADR task linking** | `adr_task_links` DB table | Current | **Shipped (T4942)** |
| **Session handoff** | `session.handoff.show` | Current | **Shipped (T4915)** |
| **Session briefing** | `session.briefing.show` | Current | **Shipped (T4916)** |
| **Composite planning view** | `tasks.plan` | Current | **Shipped (T4914)** |
| **Pipeline validation (SQLite)** | `pipeline.*` (init, advance, complete, cancel, list, stats) | Current | **Shipped (T4912)** |
| **3-layer retrieval: find** | `memory.find` | Current | **Shipped (T5149/T5241)** |

| Decision memory find | `memory.decision.find` | 2 | **Shipped (T5149/T5241)** |
| Pattern memory store | `memory.pattern.store` | 2 | **Shipped (T4768)** |
| Pattern memory find | `memory.pattern.find` | 2 | **Shipped (T4768/T5241)** |
| Pattern memory stats | `memory.pattern.stats` | 2 | **Shipped (T4768)** |
| Learning memory store | `memory.learning.store` | 3 | **Shipped (T4769)** |
| Learning memory find | `memory.learning.find` | 3 | **Shipped (T4769/T5241)** |

| Memory export (JSONL) | `memory.export` | 2 | Planned |
| Memory import (JSONL) | `memory.import` | 2 | Planned |
| Contradiction detection | `memory.contradictions` | Current | Shipped |

**Note on ADR Memory (T4942)**: ADRs are the first shipped implementation of the decision memory concept defined in this ADR. The `architecture_decisions` SQLite table, `adr_task_links`, and `adr_relations` junction tables form a relational decision memory store. `admin.adr.find` provides cognitive retrieval over this store using score-weighted fuzzy search across `Summary`, `Keywords`, and `Topics` fields. This is the concrete shipped precursor to the full `memory.decision.*` capability planned for Phase 2.

### 5.2 Reasoning (Inference) — Domain: DEFERRED (See Section 2.5)

| Critical path analysis | `orchestrate.critical.path` | Current | Shipped |
| Cross-project similarity | `nexus.find` | Current | Shipped (unvalidated) |

**Note**: Existing reasoning-adjacent operations remain in their current domains. The `reason.*` namespace is reserved pending R&C outcome.

### 5.3 Agent (Orchestration) — Domain: `orchestrate` + `tools`

| Capability | Domain.Operation | Phase | Status |
|------------|-----------------|-------|--------|
| Multi-agent spawning | `orchestrate.spawn` | Current | Shipped |

| Task validation | `check.task` | Current | Shipped |
| Coherence checks | `check.coherence.check` | Current | Shipped |
| Compliance summary | `check.compliance.summary` | Current | Shipped |
| Test execution | `check.test.run` | Current | Shipped |
| Lifecycle gates | `pipeline.stage.gates` | Current | Shipped |
| Compliance scoring | `check.compliance.score` | 1 | Planned |
| Error pattern learning | `check.intelligence.learn` | 2 | Planned |
| Adaptive validation | `check.intelligence.adapt` | 2 | Planned |
| Auto-remediation | `check.intelligence.fix` | 2 | Planned |
| Proactive suggestions | `check.intelligence.suggest` | 3 | Planned |
| Quality prediction | `check.intelligence.predict` | 3 | Planned |
| Suggestion acceptance tracking | `check.intelligence.feedback` | 3 | Planned |

### 5.5 Network (Cross-Project) — Domain: `nexus`

| Capability | Domain.Operation | Phase | Status |
|------------|-----------------|-------|--------|
| Cross-project search | `nexus.find` | Current | Shipped (unvalidated) |
| Project registry | `nexus.registry` (via admin) | Current | Shipped |

| Cross-project import | `nexus.import` | 1 | Planned |
| Knowledge transfer | `nexus.transfer` | 2 | Planned |
| Pattern library (global) | `nexus.patterns.list` | 2 | Planned |
| Pattern export | `nexus.patterns.export` | 2 | Planned |
| Pattern import | `nexus.patterns.import` | 2 | Planned |
| Project similarity | `nexus.similarity` | 2 | Planned |
| Federated agent registry | `nexus.agents` | 3 | Planned |
| Cross-project coordination | `nexus.coordinate` | 3 | Planned |
| Global intelligence | `nexus.insights` | 3 | Planned |

**Contingency**: Network dimension expansion is gated on Nexus validation (Phase 1). If validation fails, defer all Phase 2+ Network operations.

---

## 6. Pipeline Stage Correction

### 6.1 Canonical 9-Stage Pipeline (RCASD)

Per ADR-014, the lifecycle pipeline is **9 stages** — the original 8-stage RCSD model was extended with `architecture_decision` as a formal stage:

```
RCASD Phase (5 stages, per ADR-014):
  research → consensus → architecture_decision → specification → decomposition

IVTR Phase (4 stages):
  implementation → validation → testing → release
```

**Note**: Per ADR-014, the pipeline was renamed from RCSD to RCASD with `architecture_decision` added as a formal stage (not just a cross-cutting protocol). Pipeline validation tests (T4912) confirm all 9 stages work in SQLite.

### 6.2 ADR-006 Schema Correction — Applied

The `lifecycle_stages` table CHECK constraint in ADR-006 has been corrected to match the 9-stage RCASD model:

**Original** (ADR-006, incorrect):
```sql
CHECK(stage_name IN ('research', 'consensus', 'adr', 'spec', 'decompose',
                      'implement', 'verify', 'test', 'release'))
```

**Current** (per ADR-014, implemented in schema and validated by T4912):
```sql
CHECK(stage_name IN ('research', 'consensus', 'architecture_decision',
                      'specification', 'decomposition',
                      'implementation', 'validation', 'testing', 'release'))
```

### 6.3 Cross-Cutting Protocols

| Protocol | Type | Triggered During | Produces |
|----------|------|-----------------|----------|
| **Contribution Protocol** | Collaborative work | Any stage | Contribution records, agent outputs |

**Note**: `architecture_decision` was promoted from a cross-cutting protocol to a formal pipeline stage in ADR-014. The Contribution Protocol remains cross-cutting.

## 8. Contradictions Resolved

| # | Contradiction | Resolution | Authority |
|---|--------------|------------|-----------|
| 1 | BRAIN Spec says JSONL memory files; ADR-006 says SQLite only | SQLite is runtime store. JSONL is export/import format for portability. | ADR-006 (accepted) |
| 2 | cognitive-architecture.mdx says "Vectorless RAG"; BRAIN Spec says SQLite-vec | Both coexist. Vectorless RAG is primary (structural). Vectors augment for semantic queries in Phase 2+. | This ADR |
| 3 | ADR-006 schema has 9 stages with "adr"; ADR-007 says 8 stages | **Resolved (T4863)**: 9 pipeline stages + contribution cross-cutting. `architecture_decision` replaced "adr" as a formal stage. DB schema updated. | ADR-007, ADR-014 |
| 4 | Nexus storage: ADR-006 says ~/.cleo/nexus.db; others say JSON files | SQLite (nexus.db) is canonical per ADR-006. JSON references are pre-SQLite. | ADR-006 (accepted) |
| 5 | BRAIN Spec defines `cleo reason *` commands; ADR-007 maps to `memory.reason.*` | Reasoning domain placement deferred to R&C cycle. Namespace reserved. | This ADR |
| 6 | 5 Pillars and 5 BRAIN Dimensions never formally related | Orthogonal frameworks: Pillars = product contract (WHAT), BRAIN = capability model (HOW). Crosswalk in Section 2.2. | This ADR |

### 9.1 BRAIN Phase 1: Working Memory Loop — Shipped (T4911)

The first concrete BRAIN implementation is the **working memory loop** — a set of operations that give agents continuous situational awareness across the full task lifecycle. These were shipped as part of epic T4911 (BRAIN Foundation).

**The Working Memory Loop**:

```
Session Start                    Session End
     │                                │
     ▼                                ▼
session.briefing.show ──────► tasks.plan ──────► session.handoff.show
  (what happened last)     (what to work on)    (what to tell next agent)
     │                          │                       │
     └── reads from ◄──────────┘                       │
         handoff_json                                   │
         (previous session's                            │
          handoff output)                               │
                                                        ▼
                                              Persisted to handoff_json
                                              column in sessions table
                                              (auto-computed on session.end)
```

**Shipped Operations (T4911)**:

| Operation | Task | What It Does |
|-----------|------|-------------|
| `session.briefing.show` | T4916 | Aggregates 6 data sources (last handoff, in-progress tasks, open bugs, recent completions, active session, pipeline status) into a single briefing for the incoming agent |
| `tasks.plan` | T4914 | Composite planning view: in-progress epics with completion %, ready tasks ranked by leverage, blocked tasks with blocker chains, open bugs by severity |
| `session.handoff.show` | T4915 | Computes and returns handoff data (completed tasks, decisions, blockers, next actions); auto-persisted to `handoff_json` column on `session.end` |
| `ct bug` | T4913 | Quick bug creation with P0-P3 severity mapping, supporting the planning view's bug aggregation |

**Pipeline Foundation (T4912)**:
26 integration tests validate the full SQLite pipeline lifecycle: init → advance through RCASD stages → complete/cancel, with gate results, evidence recording, and statistics queries. This proves the lifecycle tables work end-to-end and unblocks T4785 (lifecycle engine → core migration).

**Verb Standard Note**: `tasks.plan` uses the `plan` verb (37th canonical verb, added to VERB-STANDARDS.md v2026.2.27). This is a composite read operation — it does not compute a derived value (`compute`) or schedule future work (`schedule`). See VERB-STANDARDS.md §33 for rationale.

### 9.2 BRAIN Phase 2: Pattern and Learning Memory — Shipped (T4763)

The second BRAIN implementation phase delivers the **pattern memory** and **learning memory** systems, along with formal JSON schemas and CLI/MCP integration.

**Implemented Components**:

| Component | Task | Files |
|-----------|------|-------|
| Memory layer design | T4766 | `schemas/brain-decision.schema.json`, `schemas/brain-pattern.schema.json`, `schemas/brain-learning.schema.json` |
| Pattern Memory system | T4768 | `src/core/memory/patterns.ts` |
| Learning Memory system | T4769 | `src/core/memory/learnings.ts` |
| Memory CLI commands | T4770 | `src/cli/commands/memory-brain.ts` |
| MCP dispatch wiring | T4770 | `src/dispatch/domains/memory.ts`, `src/core/memory/engine-compat.ts` |
| Graph systems audit | T4767 | `.cleo/rcsd/T4767_graph-systems-audit.md` |
| Bootstrap/decision refactor verification | T4764, T4765 | Already completed by T4784, T4782 |

**Storage Model** (current):
- Runtime store: SQLite `brain.db` — `brain_patterns` and `brain_learnings` tables (migrated from JSONL in T5149)
- Export format: JSONL, validated against `schemas/brain-*.schema.json`
- Legacy: JSONL files at `.cleo/memory/patterns.jsonl` and `.cleo/memory/learnings.jsonl` (retired)

**MCP Operations Added**:
- `memory.pattern.store` (mutate) — Store or increment a pattern entry
- `memory.pattern.search` (query) — Search patterns by type, impact, query, frequency
- `memory.pattern.stats` (query) — Aggregate pattern statistics
- `memory.learning.store` (mutate) — Store or merge a learning entry
- `memory.learning.search` (query) — Search learnings by confidence, actionability, query
- `memory.learning.stats` (query) — Aggregate learning statistics

## 10. Compliance Criteria

This decision is compliant when:

1. All BRAIN memory stores (decisions, patterns, learnings) use SQLite tables at runtime
2. JSONL export/import operations exist for BRAIN memory portability
3. ADR-006 `lifecycle_stages` schema corrected to 9 RCASD stages (per ADR-014)
4. ADR-007 Section 4.2 updated with comprehensive BRAIN dimension coverage (per Section 5 of this ADR)
5. Reasoning domain placement R&C task created and tracked
6. No document in the codebase contradicts the authority hierarchy in Section 7
7. BRAIN Spec (CLEO-PORTABLE-PROJECT-BRAIN-SPEC.md) updated to reference SQLite tables instead of JSONL files for runtime storage
8. cognitive-architecture.mdx updated to clarify vectorless RAG as primary with future vector augmentation

## 11. Notes

### 11.1 Agent-Native Design Principle

CLEO is built for LLM agents, not humans. Every BRAIN capability MUST be evaluated from the perspective of how an autonomous agent would invoke it during a workflow. The deferred Reasoning domain placement reflects this principle: we will not commit a domain structure based on human mental models of reasoning. Instead, we will research how agents actually use analytical operations in practice.

### 11.2 Progressive Disclosure

BRAIN capabilities follow the same progressive disclosure tiers as ADR-007:

- **Tier 0** (80% of agents): `tasks` + `session` = basic task work, no BRAIN features needed
- **Tier 1** (15% of agents): + `memory`, `check` = decision memory, compliance scoring
- **Tier 2** (5% of agents): + `orchestrate`, `pipeline`, `tools`, `admin`, `nexus` = full BRAIN capabilities

Most agents never need BRAIN features. They are opt-in capabilities for complex workflows.

### 11.3 Certification Gate

Before CLEO can claim "BRAIN" capability status, all 5 dimensions MUST pass certification criteria defined in CLEO-STRATEGIC-ROADMAP-SPEC.md Section 3.6 (Phase 3.5). This requires HITL sign-off.
