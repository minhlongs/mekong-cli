# Autonomy Gaps

> Re-verified: 2026-09-12 · HEAD: e3859ec78

All 11 gaps below were re-assessed against the tree at HEAD `e3859ec78`.
**All 11 remain CLOSED.** Production wiring defects previously weakening Gaps #4, #5, #6, #10, and #11 in `src/commands/run.py` have been resolved via real telemetry sinks, active governance gates, cost ceiling enforcement, and mission tracing (PR #4, 20/20 tests in `tests/test_run_command_wiring.py`).

**Test evidence:** 60/60 targeted gap-closure and wiring tests pass at HEAD
(`tests/test_run_command_wiring.py`, `tests/test_buzz_transport.py`,
`tests/test_mission_tracer.py`, `tests/test_e2e_mission.py`,
`tests/test_10_missions.py`, `tests/test_tool_permission_registry.py`).

## Missing Interfaces

### 1. Buzz Integration Adapter

**Status:** CLOSED (re-verified 2026-08-31)

**Gap:** No adapter exists to receive goals from Buzz and feed them into `MekongCoreRuntime`.

**Required interface:**
```python
class BuzzAdapter(Protocol):
    def receive_goal(self, payload: dict) -> Goal: ...
    def send_update(self, status: str, data: dict) -> None: ...
    def receive_feedback(self, feedback: dict) -> None: ...
```

**Verdict at HEAD:** `BuzzAdapter` exists with all three methods
(`buzz_adapter.py:26-170`). `receive_goal` parses `goal`/`text`, `context`,
`callback_url`, `mission_id` and raises on a missing goal. `send_update`
delivers status updates over standard library `urllib.request` with JSON payload,
enforces fail-closed configuration validation (`BuzzConfigError` when unconfigured
in strict mode), and provides non-crashing network fault tolerance during mission execution.
Tested by 49 comprehensive unit and integration tests (`tests/test_buzz_transport.py`).
`runtime.run_from_payload` wraps the adapter for structured goals.

**Risk:** RESOLVED — Buzz integration transport is fully functional with live stdlib transport.

---

### 2. Stream / Structured Output on LLMRouter

**Status:** CLOSED (re-verified 2026-09-12)

**Gap:** `LLMRouter` Protocol has `generate()` returning `str`. Native token streaming and structured output needed across the transport stack.

**Required additions:**
```python
def stream(self, prompt: str, model: str | None = None) -> Iterator[str]: ...
def structured_output(self, prompt: str, schema: dict, model: str | None = None) -> dict: ...
```

**Verdict at HEAD:** Fully resolved across the entire stack.
Both methods exist on the Protocol (`protocols.py:147-148`) and are implemented in `LLMRouterAdapter`.
- `OpenAICompatibleProvider.stream()` parses SSE events (`data: {...}`) line-by-line using stdlib `urllib.request` and yields individual token deltas until `[DONE]`.
- `LLMClient.stream()` iterates across healthy candidates with circuit breaker tracking, pre-request hooks, LRU cache check, and offline fallback.
- `LLMRouterAdapter.stream()` delegates directly to `LLMClient.stream()`, with backward-compatibility fallback to `chat()` for unit test mocks.
- `structured_output` delegates to `LLMClient.generate_json` (`llm_router_adapter.py`).
- Tested by 18 unit and integration tests in `tests/test_llm_router_stream.py`.

**Risk:** RESOLVED — Native token-by-token streaming is active across transport, client, and protocol adapter.

---

### 3. Memory Separation (Short-term vs Long-term)

**Status:** CLOSED (re-verified 2026-08-23)

**Gap:** Single `MemoryStore` / `ScopedMemoryStore`. No distinction between session memory (short-term) and persistent knowledge (long-term).

**Required interface:**
```python
class MemoryTier(Enum):
    SESSION = "session"    # Ephemeral, cleared after goal
    PERSISTENT = "persistent"  # Survives across goals
    ARCHIVE = "archive"    # Cold storage

class MemorySeparation(Protocol):
    def store(self, key: str, value: bytes, tier: Any = ..., ttl: Optional[int] = None) -> None: ...
    def retrieve(self, key: str, tier: Any = ...) -> Optional[bytes]: ...
    def flush_session(self) -> int: ...
    def prune_expired(self) -> int: ...
```

**Verdict at HEAD:** `MemoryTier` defines SESSION/PERSISTENT/ARCHIVE with TTLs
(`memory_separation.py:19-31`). `MemorySeparation` protocol is exposed in `src/core/protocols.py`.
`flush_session` and `prune_expired` are wired into `ScopedMemoryStore` and runtime session lifecycle
(`runtime_adapter.py:_flush_session_keys`).

**Risk:** RESOLVED — TTL-based eviction supported via prune_expired() and ScopedMemoryStore integration.

---

### 4. Mission-Level Observability

**Status:** CLOSED (re-verified 2026-08-31)

**Gap:** Telemetry traces individual operations. No end-to-end mission trace (goal → plan → execute → verify → commit).

**Required interface:**
```python
class MissionTracer(Protocol):
    def start_mission(self, goal: str) -> MissionId: ...
    def log_step(self, mission_id: MissionId, step: str, result: Result) -> None: ...
    def end_mission(self, mission_id: MissionId, outcome: str) -> MissionRecord: ...
    def query_missions(self, filter: MissionFilter) -> list[MissionRecord]: ...
```

**Verdict at HEAD:** `mission_tracer.py` is intact and wired into the runtime
(`runtime_adapter.py:134` tracer field, `:170-181` start_mission, `:449-476`
step/finish). Production wiring in `src/commands/run.py:218-219` instantiates
`MissionTracer()` and starts the mission on the runtime (`runtime.start_mission(goal, tracer=tracer)`), ensuring `mission_id` is stamped and steps/outcomes are fully recorded for CLI missions. Tested by `tests/test_run_command_wiring.py:TestEndToEndRun`.

**Risk:** RESOLVED — End-to-end mission tracing is active in both runtime and CLI production path.

---

## Unsafe Execution Paths

### 5. No Approval Gate for HIGH Risk Actions

**Status:** CLOSED (re-verified 2026-08-31)

**Gap:** `Governance.classify()` classifies actions but `runtime_adapter.py` doesn't gate execution based on classification.

**Current flow:**
```
runtime.execute(task) → delegates → runs tool
```

**Missing gate:**
```
runtime.execute(task) → governance.classify(task) → if HIGH: require_approval() → if FORBIDDEN: deny
```

**Verdict at HEAD:** The gate is implemented in `execute()`
(`runtime_adapter.py:254-278`) — FORBIDDEN is denied, REVIEW_REQUIRED requires
approval. Production constructor (`run.py:86, 128`) injects `governance = Governance()`,
so the gate is fully ACTIVE in production wiring for `mekong run`: review-class
goals fail closed unless `GOVERNANCE_AUTO_APPROVE` is explicitly set, and forbidden
goals are unconditionally blocked. Verified by `tests/test_run_command_wiring.py:TestEndToEndRun`.

**Risk:** RESOLVED — Destructive/high-risk actions are gated in the autonomous loop and CLI.

**Fix:** Add `execute_with_governance()` method that checks `ActionClass` before delegating.

---

### 6. No Cost Limit Enforcement

**Status:** CLOSED (re-verified 2026-08-31)

**Gap:** `LLMRouter.estimate_cost()` exists but cost is never checked against budget/limit before execution.

**Current flow:**
```
runtime.execute(task) → estimate_cost() → ignore result → execute
```

**Missing gate:**
```
runtime.execute(task) → estimate_cost() → if cost > budget: pause/approve
```

**Risk:** RESOLVED — Per-mission cost ceiling is enforced before LLM calls.

**Implemented:** `MekongCoreRuntimeImpl` accepts an optional `max_cost_usd`
ceiling (`runtime_adapter.py:120,136`). `_check_cost_guard()`
(`runtime_adapter.py:411-430`) accumulates estimated cost across tasks and
returns an error string when the ceiling would be breached, short-circuiting
`execute()` before the LLM call. Spend is tracked on `_spent_cost_usd` and
reset per mission via `start_mission()`.

**Verdict at HEAD:** Production wiring in `src/commands/run.py:47-61, 130` wires
`max_cost_usd=_resolve_max_cost_usd(max_cost_usd)` with a $5.00 default and
CLI/env overrides (`--max-cost-usd`, `MEKONG_MAX_COST_USD`), activating the cost
guard on every run. Verified by `tests/test_run_command_wiring.py:TestCostCeilingResolution`
and `TestEndToEndRun:test_cost_ceiling_blocks_execution`.

---

### 7. No Retry Limit on repair()

**Status:** CLOSED (re-verified 2026-08-23)

**Gap:** `repair()` method has no retry limit. Could loop infinitely on persistent failures.

**Current flow:**
```
verify() fails → repair() → execute() → verify() → repair() → ... (no limit)
```

**Missing gate:**
```
verify() fails → if retries < MAX_RETRIES: repair() else: abort
```

**Risk:** MEDIUM — Infinite repair loops could exhaust resources.

**Verdict at HEAD:** `_MAX_REPAIR_ATTEMPTS = 3` (`runtime_adapter.py:116`).
The task loop (`runtime_adapter.py:392-409`) caps repair attempts, and
`repair()` escalates after 3 retries (`runtime_adapter.py:346-354`).

**Fix:** Add `_repair_count` field to `MekongCoreRuntimeImpl`. Abort after N retries.

---

## State/Memory Ownership Problems

### 8. No Clear Memory Owner

**Status:** CLOSED-within-runtime (re-verified 2026-08-23)

**Gap:** Multiple systems write to memory (`MemoryStore`, `ScopedMemoryStore`, `NeuralMemoryClient`, `MemoryBridge`). No single owner.

**Current state:**
- `runtime_adapter.py` writes observations via `remember()`
- `memory_store_adapter.py` bridges to `MemoryStore`
- `memory_scope.py` adds org isolation
- `memory_client.py` writes to neural store

**Problem:** No transaction boundary. Partial writes on failure.

**Fix:** Designate `ScopedMemoryStore` as canonical owner. All writes go through it.

**Implemented:** `MemorySeparation.store_raw()` is the single write path for
untagged entries — every fallback route now lands on the canonical
`ScopedMemoryStore` backend. The `remember()` method in `runtime_adapter.py`
falls back to `store_raw()` (not a second backend) when the tiered `store()`
fails (`runtime_adapter.py:360-370`), ensuring there is exactly one memory
owner within the runtime. **Caveat:** broader multi-store sprawl across the
repo (tenants.db, seed memory, memory_canonical vs memory_store) persists
outside the runtime boundary.

---

### 9. No Capability State Ownership

**Status:** CLOSED (re-verified 2026-08-23)

**Gap:** `CapabilityBus` registers capabilities but doesn't track who registered them or when they expire.

**Current state:** Capabilities are registered in a dict. No lifecycle management.

**Problem:** Stale capabilities accumulate. No cleanup.

**Fix:** Add `registered_by`, `registered_at`, `expires_at` to `Capability` dataclass. Add cleanup method to `CapabilityBus`.

**Implemented:** `Capability` now carries ownership fields
(`registered_by`/`registered_at`/`expires_at`, `capability.py:64-66`) plus
`is_expired()` (`capability.py:73`). `InMemoryCapabilityBus` is the canonical
implementation: it stamps a default owner on `register()`, refuses expired
capabilities in `execute()`, and evicts them in `cleanup()`. The
`CapabilityBus` Protocol gained a `cleanup()` method so any adapter can
implement the same lifecycle.

---

## Missing Observability

### 10. No Trace Correlation IDs

**Status:** CLOSED (re-verified 2026-08-31)

**Gap:** Telemetry events have no correlation ID linking them to a mission or goal.

**Current state:** Each event has `timestamp` and `payload`. No `mission_id` or `goal_id`.

**Problem:** Cannot trace a full autonomous run from start to finish.

**Verdict at HEAD:** `TelemetryEvent` carries `mission_id`
(`telemetry_collector.py:39`), and the runtime propagates it into emitted
events (`runtime_adapter.py:328,389`). Because `run.py:218-219` explicitly calls
`runtime.start_mission(goal, tracer=tracer)` before executing tasks, `_mission_id`
is active for CLI runs as well as payload runs, ensuring all telemetry events
carry proper mission correlation IDs.

**Risk:** RESOLVED — Correlation IDs are attached to all telemetry events.

---

### 11. No Cost Tracking in Telemetry

**Status:** CLOSED (re-verified 2026-08-31)

**Gap:** `estimate_cost()` returns cost but cost is never emitted to telemetry.

**Current state:** Cost is calculated but discarded.

**Problem:** Cannot track spending per mission/agent/task.

**Verdict at HEAD:** `estimated_cost` is computed in `execute()`
(`runtime_adapter.py:283-290`) and propagated through `observe()` into the
telemetry event (`runtime_adapter.py:317-333`), so cost lands in telemetry and
memory per task. In production wiring, `TelemetrySinkAdapter` captures and emits
these events reliably.

**Risk:** RESOLVED — Cost is tracked in telemetry and memory.

---

## NEW WIRING DEFECTS AUDIT (RESOLVED)

The production-wiring defects noted in the 2026-08-23 audit have been resolved:

1. **`mekong run` production path:** RESOLVED (PR #4). `_NullTelemetry` was replaced
   with `TelemetrySinkAdapter` conforming to `protocols.ObservabilitySink`. `src/commands/run.py`
   wires `governance=Governance()`, `max_cost_usd=_resolve_max_cost_usd(...)`,
   and `tracer=MissionTracer()`. Verified by 20/20 tests in `tests/test_run_command_wiring.py`.
2. **`GOVERNANCE_AUTO_APPROVE` env flag:** Intended design for CI/CD and non-interactive testing.
   In standard runs it defaults to unset (false), strictly blocking `REVIEW_REQUIRED` actions.
3. **dna manifests are eval-time-only:** Known scope boundary; core governance handles live enforcement.

## License Gating (post-deletion status)

License gating is **INTACT** after the `license_gate_core.py` deletion. The
gate now lives inline in `src/lib/raas_gate/__init__.py:64-243`
(`RaasLicenseGate`), is consumed by the middleware `src/middleware/license_gate.py:52`,
which is wired into `src/api/gateway_mission_routes.py:31,60`, and is backed by
`engine/license/`. No regression from the sweep.
