## 1. Before / After

| Area | Before (at `d6138541a`) | After (v0.1) |
|------|------------------------|--------------|
| Mission trace | Plain `run()` never started a mission → `mission_id=None`, truncated traces | `run()` starts mission idempotently; payload path keeps pre-assigned ids; full start/step/finish traces |
| Lifecycle docs | None | Pinned contract: 10 stages ↔ methods, tested by `tests/test_core_lifecycle_contract.py` |
| Capability bus | Defined but 0 production importers | Injected into `mekong run` by default (11 builtin capabilities), failure-tolerant |
| Policy decisions | 3-class governance, silent `GOVERNANCE_AUTO_APPROVE` bypass | Single decision path: 4-level risk map, audit on every decision, loud WARNING bypass, CRITICAL+AUTO registration rejected |
| Payments | `PaymentProvider` had 0 conformant implementations; settle stub | Protocol extended (quote/request/verify/refund); `BillingAdapter` conforms; deterministic idempotent mock; x402-shape pure-data codec; **SC5: scheme-agnostic x402 + MPP providers, fail-closed config, no custody** |
| Buzz | `send_update` built dicts, posted nothing | Injectable `(url,payload)->int` transport (stdlib urllib), no-op without callback; versioned `BuzzRuntimeAdapter` v0.1 with cooperative cancel; **SC5: canonical Buzz transport, hermetic-by-injection, fail-loud `BuzzConfigError` at call time** |
| Execution isolation | No abstraction | `ExecutionRuntime` Protocol + `LocalExecutionRuntime` (sanitizer-gated shell, confined filesystem, timeouts, cancel) |
| Duplication | PEV planner byte-identical to core planner (691 lines) | Deleted; importers repointed; convergence pinned by tests |
| CLI self-description | CLAUDE.md cited phantom layers (tree/forest/land) + "43 commands" | Accurate layer map, build_app-derived 36 groups |
| Core/adapter boundary | `src/core/` imported vendor SDKs at module level | **SC5: clean boundary — `src/core/` no longer imports vendor SDKs or adapter implementations at module level** |
| LLM provider port | Multiple provider shapes, no single interface | **SC5: canonical `LLMProvider` port (generate/stream/structured_output/tool_call/health); two providers satisfy the same interface** |
| Agent registry | Python discovery + CLI duplicated agent definitions | **SC5: YAML single-source-of-truth; Python discovery and CLI are adapters** |
| Capability bus | Defined but 0 production importers | Injected into `mekong run` by default (11 builtin capabilities), failure-tolerant; **SC5: MCP→capability bridge (`mcp:<tool_name>` ids), tool-capability adapter** |
| Cloudflare runtime | Core bound to CF runtime at one import site | **SC5: `CloudflareTransport(Protocol)` with `.dispatch(payload) -> dict`; single import site isolated** |

```

## 5. Key flows

**MCP:** external FastMCP server → `sync_from_mcp()` → capabilities tagged
`source=MCP` on the bus → e2e test executes `mcp:*` through the same bus +
governance path as builtins. Client-side MCP consumption deferred.

**Buzz:** payload `{goal|text, mission_id?, callback_url?}` → session/mission
assignment → core loop under tracer → outcome {completed, cancelled, failed}
POSTed via transport when callback present; approval requests deny-by-default.

**Payment:** `quote(amount,currency,recipient,scheme)` →
`request_payment(PaymentRequest w/ idempotency_key)` → `PaymentReceipt` →
`verify(receipt)` → `refund`. Mock replays return identical receipts and
settle exactly once. Real settlement does not exist in v0.1.

## 6. Security boundaries (enforced)

1. **Vendor-SDK gate** — no anthropic/openai imports anywhere in
   `src/core/`; HTTP-lib allowlist enumerated exactly
   (`tests/test_core_boundary.py`).
2. **Shell sanitizer** — string commands pass
   `CommandSanitizer(strict_mode=True)`; injection patterns blocked
   (tested: `rm -rf /`, chaining, backticks).
3. **Filesystem confinement** — resolve-then-verify inside sandbox root,
   symlink-aware; traversal escapes raise.
4. **Governance deny + always-audit** — CRITICAL denied unconditionally;
   every decision writes an audit entry; bypass is loud.
5. **No custody** — economic code holds no keys/wallets/network; x402
   decode rejects key-like fields; negative tests assert receipts/logs stay
   secret-free.
6. **Protected paths untouched** — `src/gateway.py`, `src/raas/nowpayments_*`,
   `src/api/billing_routes.py`, `src/middleware/license_gate.py`,
   `src/lib/raas_gate/` all byte-unchanged (diff grep empty).
7. **No new dependencies** — transports use stdlib urllib.

## 7. Test coverage

Suite at code HEAD (E6 parity run): **277 failed / 7,650 passed /
75 skipped** with `--ignore=tests/test_world_model.py` (known hang, escrowed);
normalized fail-set diff vs base baseline = **exact match, 0 new failures**.
~181 new tests across 9 new suites + extensions (ledger in §3). The 277
failures are the pre-existing baseline carried from Wave 3 — not caused by
this branch, but they cap the honesty of any "green" claim.

## 8. Gaps (deferred by design — stop condition)

1. Real multi-step `plan()`; multi-agent `delegate()` (both stubs).
2. GoalEngine protocol conformance (`src/mekongcli` engine stays live).
3. MemoryStore convergence — 0 conformant implementations, 3-way split.
4. Harness verifier merge + DAG scheduler swap.
5. MCP client-side consumption of external servers.
6. Real x402/MPP settlement, marketplace, tokenomics, custody.
7. New CLI surface (mk mission/agent/run/approve/…).
8. Full sandbox/App Factory beyond the `ExecutionRuntime` primitive.
9. Tier-config duality; 4 payment route families; COMMAND_REGISTRY rewrite;
   funnel restoration (Zalo/tax/vn-setup).
10. MOVE `llm_client.py` out of core/ (46 file references).
11. Carried over: `LLMRouter.tool_call()` missing (no v0.1 lane); native
    streaming absent; world_model hang unfixed; NetworkPolicy placeholder.

## 9. Debt register

- `GOVERNANCE_AUTO_APPROVE` remains an env var — fine for solo ops, wrong
  for multi-tenant.
- Unknown risk levels fail open to SAFE (documented, deliberate).
- Audit sink failure-tolerant to memory only — no durable queue.
- `InMemoryCapabilityBus` — no persistence or cross-process sharing.
- Baseline suite redness (277) masks regressions in covered areas; parity
  discipline compensates but is manual.
- Docs outside this set (roadmap, COMMAND_REGISTRY, several architecture/
  maps) still describe pre-Wave-3 reality.

## 10. Scores — 10 dimensions (/100, brutally honest)

| Dimension | Score | Justification |
|-----------|------:|---------------|
| Architecture | **78** | One lifecycle, four buses, enforced boundaries, clean CORE/ADAPTERS split; dragged down by stub planner/delegate and memory split |
| Autonomy | **55** | Risk map + audit + declarative agents exist; approvals are env-var only, unknown-risk fails open, no human-in-loop surface |
| Prod-readiness | **40** | Mock-only payments, unenforced network policy, 277 baseline failures, single-node bus |
| Provider-neutrality | **85** | Test-enforced SDK gate with exact allowlist; canonical LLM port with two conformant providers |
| Capability coverage | **70** | Builtins + MCP wired end-to-end, MCP→capability bridge, tool-capability adapter; no persistence, no authz model beyond risk level |
| Policy coherence | **78** | Genuinely one decision path, audited; fail-open default and env bypass are honest scars |
| Economic-readiness | **55** | Scheme-agnostic x402 + MPP providers, fail-closed config, no custody; zero real settlement, NOWPayments migration untouched |
| Buzz-readiness | **70** | Canonical transport, hermetic-by-injection, fail-loud at call time; in-process only, no auth/retry/backoff |
| Docs completeness | **75** | v0.2 set refreshed for SC5; legacy docs stale |
| Test depth | **70** | Agent-loop E2E + LLM conformance + payment fail-closed + registry YAML tests; overall suite still carries a red baseline |
| **Average** | **65** | Honest v0.2: correct skeleton, economic + capability buses now wired |

## 11. Top 10 next actions

Ordered by leverage; each names the dimension(s) it moves most. Items marked
✓ below were the SC5 deliverables that landed this refresh; the remaining
items are the v0.2 priority queue.

1. ✓ **Canonical LLM provider port** (provider-neutrality +5) — `LLMProvider` protocol with `generate/stream/structured_output/tool_call/health`; two conformant providers; tested by `tests/ports/test_llm_conformance.py`.
2. ✓ **YAML single-source agent registry** (arch +5) — `agents/registry.yaml` is now the source of truth; Python discovery and CLI are adapters.
3. ✓ **Capability bus + MCP bridge** (capability +10) — `InMemoryCapabilityBus` with `ToolCapabilityAdapter` + `McpCapabilityAdapter`; `mcp:<tool_name>` ids; wired into `mekong run`.
4. ✓ **Scheme-agnostic economic bus** (econ +10) — x402 + MPP providers, fail-closed config, no custody; `BillingAdapter` conforms.
5. ✓ **Canonical Buzz transport** (buzz +5) — hermetic-by-injection, fail-loud `BuzzConfigError` at call time.
6. **Real multi-step `plan()` via GoalEngine conformance** (arch +5, autonomy +8) — biggest single unlock; effort L.
7. **Multi-agent `delegate()`** (autonomy +8, arch +4) — depends on #6; needs registry-driven dispatch tests.
8. **Conformant MemoryStore + convergence** (arch +6, prod +4) — removes the oldest structural lie; ~20 consumers to migrate carefully.
9. **NOWPayments → PaymentProvider remount behind a reviewed flag** (econ +20) — protected-flow lane with replay tests; do NOT rush.
10. **Real x402 settlement provider** (econ +10, prod +5) — only after #9 proves the adapter pattern on live rails.

**Deferred past the v0.2 cutoff** (tracked, not lost): enforced NetworkPolicy,
human approval surface for REVIEW_REQUIRED, MCP client-side consumption,
CLI primitives + COMMAND_REGISTRY regeneration, harness verifier merge +
DAG scheduler swap.

**STOP here per §23.** Human architect review required before Phase 3.
